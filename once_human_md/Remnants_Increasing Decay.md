This is already the fifth time this month. Keefer Sutherland has such a wide range of interests. Fine art, wine, antiques, sports cars... is there anything he doesn't indulge in? His basement must be filled with this stuff. How does he keep the damp out, I wonder? Some of those antiques look very vulnerable to dry rot.
Not that it's any concern of mine. It's just... I have this feeling in my gut that something's not quite right. Mr. Sutherland has always known how to enjoy life, but now... it's like he's lost all self-control. He's got a strange glint in his eyes these days. Sometimes I feel like he's... changed.
