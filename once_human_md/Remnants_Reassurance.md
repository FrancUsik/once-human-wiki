With Rosetta at my door, who could refuse a fortune like this? Just a small order from them and I'm made. Rafael, as long as we reach a long-term deal with Rosetta, we'll be set. This is Rosetta's first order with us, so please be careful and don't drive them away!
Before, Rosetta was only active on the other side of the river, and the factories there making a mint. Maybe they accelerated construction of that big dark tower they're building, so they came to us for raw materials. That tower is getting more unsettling by the day, but money is money!
