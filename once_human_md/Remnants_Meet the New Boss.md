Life here is a complete mess, Quentin Joyce is just another tyrant. I've already worked over sixty hours this week, but according to Mr. Joyce's standards, after deducting food and accommodation costs, I am still in debt to him! Ouch... The injury on my foot is getting worse, and I'll soon meet my end here. Laura asked me to come to her place tonight, saying that she will help me with some homemade medicine. She's kind-hearted, but unfortunately, in this place, good people have no hope.
