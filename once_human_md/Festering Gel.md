It greedily assimilates everything it touches. It starts off the size of a fist, but will quickly grow if left unchecked. It hunts by luring its prey to consume it... Doesn't it look delicious?"

Summary[]
Festering Gel is a Combat Deviation that provides Knockback and Fortification capabilities.

How To Get[]
Opportunity to secure after defeating Ravenous Hunter in Monolith of Greed (5933,-4662).
Can sometimes be obtained just outside Victor's home in Rift Space during the prologue.
There is also a chance to obtain as loot after defeating Treant at Gaia Cliff Monolith in Broken Delta.
Abilities[]
Flawless Fortification: Upon being thrown, it knocks back enemies nearby the target and forms a new fortification.
Build Fortification: Autonomously forms a fixed shelter that blocks attacks. Allied players near the shelter recover 6.0% HP and 3.0% Sanity every second.
Variants[]
The following are "Trait Variants" of Festering Gel. These variants have the same core abilities but the appearance has changed and each has additional trait-specific effects:

Festering Gel - Marine Star[]



&#160;
Trait: Starry SkyEffect: Each reload gives you either a 5% Weapon DMG bonus or 5% Status DMG bonus at random.

Festering Gel - Spring Rose[]



&#160;
Trait: Praise the SunEffect: You receive 20% more healing during the day. Effect is reduced by half at night.

Trivia[]
Due to story progression and its appearance outside Victor's home during the prologue, Festering Gel is typically the second Deviation most players acquire.
