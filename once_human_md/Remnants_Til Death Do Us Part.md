# Remnants/Til Death Do Us Part

Til Death Do Us Part[]
Jarstick
Lily, my true love, no one can separate us in this lifetime.
Lily, you may never understand how much I love you.
Every glance at your unique and adorable horns make me joyful; every touch of your smooth fur sets my heart aflutter.
Though this devout love is not accepted by the world, though I will be judged for this forbidden love, I'm willing to face punishment after I die, just to share my lifetime with you.
My Love will understand us, I am sure.
