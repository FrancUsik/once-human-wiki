Characteristics[]
At the final stage of a Gnawer’s evolution, its body becomes completely drained by Stardust, shriveling to a husk with only a small cluster of active brain cells remaining. Under certain conditions, the Gnawer gains the ability to alter its physical density, transforming into a new form—known as a Star Walker.
Star Walkers are also one of the few creatures that appear in both basic and Elite Deviant forms across Nalcott. See Elite Star Walker for more details.

Behavior[]
Star Walkers drift through the air like ominous clouds of ash. When provoked, they retaliate by launching Stardust projectiles that track and neutralize their targets.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the soft, colorful “body” concealed beneath the Star Walker’s protective carapace.

Locations[]
Star Walkers are low-ranking enemies commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Drops[]
Star Walkers either drop various scrap materials or Acid.
