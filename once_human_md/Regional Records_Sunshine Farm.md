Sunshine Farm[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
We reached Sunshine Farm at dusk. According to the records, it was once Nalcott's newest and most fancy solar-thermal power plant, built on an absurdly large scale and briefly touted as a half-baked tourist spot. There's even a rumor that, before the Starfall, Rosetta tried to buy it from the Sutherland family, but the deal never went through. Honestly, I doubt that story. Back then, real estate agents claimed a subway line was going to be built out here. We never saw a single sign of it--just the end of the world instead.
Now those crazy Vultures run the place. We could hear gunfire, angry shouts, and the faint echoes of wild celebration from miles away. They've turned the farm into bandit fortress. The old seed warehouse is now their armory. At night, the bonfires along the walls throw flickering shadows that look like some dark ritual. We didn't dare get closer. We just watched from the dark, then slipped away without a sound.
