I'm sorry, Hannah, but can you please have a word with your husband?
You know as well as I do that 3 consecutive years of crop failures has brought Citrus County to its knees. Everyone is struggling. But standing up during that meeting and raising a motion to change the town name to "Citrus-less County" like that? It was more than a little insensitive... Ok, sure - he was just trying to lighten the mood. But your husband almost reduced my Ben to tears with that "little joke." Ben didn't speak to me for hours after we got home. He just went and sat in our barren orchard all night long, brooding.
Since your husband seems to be always in such good spirits, why don't you sign him up for the next few weeks of night patrols? Captain Catherine is always short on manpower. Or, maybe he should consider spending less time cracking jokes, and a bit more time in between the sheets with you! Citrus County may be a little short on citrus right now, but no matter what, the human race must keep going!
