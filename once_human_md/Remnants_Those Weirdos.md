Those Rosetta people are really peculiar. They look like they've never experienced a moment of joy in their entire lives. Especially the security guards... Even when they come into town, they're armed to the teeth. Do you think this place is a crime hotspot? Or perhaps they believe they wouldn't survive five minutes without their weapons?
We've mentioned to Mr. Sutherland that the presence of Rosetta makes all the residents anxious. Even though their major projects bring in orders and job opportunities, we still hope for... a more normal life. But of course, it's useless. Mr. Sutherland is preoccupied with important matters, and one mustn't offend Rosetta. Well, it was expected.
The girls across the street have entertained a few security guards. They said that when they take off those black suits, they look just like everyone else, but it's obvious they've been tormented by prolonged overwork and high-dose medications, with their nerves stretched to the limit. They pay well for the service, I hear. Well enough that the girls overlook the rough treatment. It must be good money because those girls end up with bruises and swollen faces for days.
