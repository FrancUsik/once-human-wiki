Summary[]
Alkirk is located in Iron River at 6192,-2592.

History[]
The plague of Stardust had been tormenting Alkirk's residents even before the Starfall. The residents had seen the early warning signs. They didn't understand them, but they were scared, that much was clear. Rosetta had the town by the neck by the time they built their Monolith. It seems that the townsfolk were forbidden from telling the outside world about the Monolith, or any of the Deviations they were starting to experience.
That was all years ago, and the Stardust has mostly dissipated now, but the inhabitants of of Alkirk have been irrevocably transformed &#91;1&#93;.
