# Remnants/New Converts

New Converts[]
White King, Priest
Fisherman's Wharf, South Chalk Peak
August 8, ▮▮30
We are gathered here to welcome these new members into our fold and witness their transformation through the rite of baptism.
Let the seawater cleanse them! Do not fear the water's deep blue glow! This is the blessing of Stardust. The newcomers are ready, I can see it in their eyes. Not all of them will be able to withstand the grace of our lord, of course. But those who are able to emerge again from the sea will become our brothers and sisters, consecrated by Stardust!
