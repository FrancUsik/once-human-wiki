# Seeds and Agriculture

Agriculture plays a key role in keeping Meta-Human's feeling satiated and unstoppable through the use of various food and drink items.Some seeds or Deviations can be purchased from NPC vendors:

Zhao Jintan at Meyer's Market (Broken Delta): Cucumber Seeds ( 1,000body[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .energy-links-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)}) / Growshroom ( 4,000)
Jonathan at Greywater Camp (Iron River): Tomato Seeds ( 1,000) / Pup Buddy ( 6,000)
Emma Potter at Tall Grass Inn (Chalk Peak): Onion Seeds ( 1,000) / Artisan's Touch ( 8,000)
Lacey at Blackfell (Red Sands): Peppercorn Seeds ( 1,000) / Shattered Maiden ( 10,000)
Other seeds, such as the ones listed below, have a chance to be gathered by harvesting the respective plant out in the wilderness. All seeds have a chance of being found by the Fetch-A-Lot Bunny if this deviation is placed inside an Isolated Securement Unit in the player's territory.

Planting Seeds[]
There are various types of seeds in the game, obtainable through first finding the crop in the wilderness and harvesting until a seed is obtained. Below is a table demonstrating the types of seeds available and what their irrigation and lighting needs are, as well as how long they often take to grow, when planted by the player in planter boxes or loamy soil. Additionally, Growshrooms can be given 1 (one) type of seed in its inventory to plant when planter boxes or loamy soil become available to do so. To place the seeds inside the deviations inventory, you must access its Isolated Securement Unit where you will see a box for seeds.

Some seeds can become contaminated, and are obtained through harvesting contaminated crops found in the wilderness. Below is a table showing the needs and growth cycle of contaminated seeds.

Harvesting[]
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			A planted corn crop which is 8% grown 		 	 
After crops grow inside planter boxes or loamy soil there is a chance for regular non-contaminated seeds to produce a deviated crop, which will give the player the deviated version of the crop they are harvesting, but will still give regular non-contaminated seeds. Contaminated (not to be confused with deviated) crops have the potential to drop contaminated seeds, which will only grow contaminated crops. To harvest from planter boxes or loamy soil the player must interact by pressing their interact button once the growth period of the crop reaches 100%, the growth period of the crop can be seen when standing near the crop and looking at the bottom of the rectangle which also shows other important information, such as their irrigation, lighting, and plant status. Note: if flowers are harvested, they appear in the player's inventory under the construction tab. They can be placed by either hovering over their icon and pressing the use button to place them down, or by going into Build Mode, Furniture, then Decoration, being found at the bottom under Landscape Plants.
The Growshroom deviation is able to harvest crops for the player, and store them inside its Isolated Securement Unit ready for the player to collect, similarly to how the The Digby Boy will collect and store ores for the player. Note: Growshrooms will harvest any plants in both plater boxes and loamy soil, therefore, if the player wishes to have unharvested flowers as decoration in their territory it is advised to not place Growshrooms in any isolated securement units within their territory.

Building a Farm[]
There are no set ways to build a farm, however, there are different appliances and tips that can help to keep your plants happy and thriving, which may determine the way the player sets out their farm.

Phase 1 Farms[]
In the first Phase some useful appliances are not yet unlockable, and so the best way for crops to meet their needs is to either plant Loamy Soil outside, or to build a roofless farm with either Planter Boxes or Loamy Soil, to allow for direct sunlight and rain to meet those lighting and irrigation needs.
Additionally, the player can acquire the help from some of their deviations, namely the Growshroom, Rain Man, or the Buzzy Bee. The Growshroom is able to harvest and plant crops for the player. They will store the harvested crops inside their Isolated Securement Unit ready for the player to collect, similarly to how The Digby Boy will collect and store ores for the player. They will also accelerate crop growth, and the higher the deviations' skill rating, the faster acceleration of growth. The Rain Man will water nearby plants for the player, irrigating the crop to it's required amount. The Buzzy Bee will boost the mutation probability of the plants you grow, the probability of mutated crops increases with its skill rating.

Phase 2 Farms[]
Grow Lights are unlocked in the Memetics, under the Logistics section in tab 4 (unlocked in Phase 2), and allow for the player to set what lighting the plants are subject too, ranging from 0 to 100. To change the lighting level of the Grow Lights the player must look at the appliance and increase the light level, if the player accidentally increases the light level too high, or decides to plant a crop with a different light level, they can keep increasing the light level, as once it hits the maximum light level it will restart from the minimum light level. The best way to use Grow Lights is to build the lights 2 (two) walls above where the crops are planted, to ensure that 1 (one) light can shine on multiple crops.
Irrigation facilities are unlocked in the Memetics, under the Logistics section in tab 4 (unlocked in Phase 2), and allow for the player to set what irrigation level the plants are subject too, ranging from 0 to 100. To change the irrigation level of the irrigation facilities, the player must look at the appliance and increase the irrigation level. Same as the above, if players need a lower irrigation level to the one set they can keep increasing the irrigation level, as once it hits the maximum irrigation level it will restart from the minimum irrigation level. The best way to set up irrigation facilities is to have plants boxed around it, as they reach around 3 planters diagonally, when building the automatic irrigation facility an outline as to its reach can be seen. To maximize the amount of plants around the facility, the facility should be in the center, with 8 Planter Boxes placed around it in a square for the first layer, then 16 around those 8 to enlarge the square, and finally 21 around those 16 to enlarge the square 1 (one) more time.

Deviated Plant Growing[]
Deviated versions of plants that can be obtained in the wilderness are indicated by a purple and pink aura surrounding the plant. For crops that cannot be found in the wilderness, but can be grown in Loamy Soil or Planter Boxes, there are a few ways to increase the chances of obtaining a deviated version.

Fertilizer[]
Fertilizer - Mutation Boost is a fertilizer that can be crafted once the player has unlocked the memetic: Fertilizer - Mutation Boost, on the Logistics page. It costs 3x Fertilizer, 30x Stardust Source, and 5x Mushrooms. It increases the chances that a crop will become deviated, but does not guarantee it.
Improved Compound Fertilizer is another fertilizer that can be crafted, but only if the player is fortunate enough to obtain the Memetic Specialization Improved Compound Fertilizer. It costs 3x Deviated Mushroom and 10x Fertilizer. It increases the chances that a crop will become deviated and increases the yield of the crop, but does not guarantee that the crop will become deviated, and slows the growth rate of the crop.

Deviations[]
The Growshroom and Buzzy Bee both increase the chances that a crop will become deviated. Growshrooms enhance crop mutation rates, whereas Buzzy Bees increase the chances for a crop to mutate while it is growing.

Trivia[]
Although orange seeds can be found in game, apple seeds cannot.
In real life, peppercorns are actually the fruits of the Black pepper flowering vine in the family Piperaceae. Peppercorns are usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning.
