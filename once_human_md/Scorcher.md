Characteristics[]
The Scorcher’s hulking body is filled with boiling paraffin. Its head resembles a rocket engine nozzle, though it lacks the structure to function like any known man-made machine. The Scorcher’s oversized head has not fully fused with its body; instead, it retains several twisted digits that allow it to move independently.

Behavior[]
When the Scorcher encounters its prey, it ignites the paraffin within its body, launching scorching flames from its head to reduce its victims to ashes. “Splitting up” is this Deviant’s specialty. When it suffers irreparable damage, its head detaches from its failing body to flank the enemy. These two frenzied sources of fire can instantly transform a radius of several meters into a sea of flames.

Strategy[]
To maximize damage, target the glowing section on the Scorcher’s furnace-like head. If you don’t defeat the Scorcher quickly, it will split into two separate targets: its head and body. If the head detaches, aim for the large wound at the top of the body where the head once connected.
