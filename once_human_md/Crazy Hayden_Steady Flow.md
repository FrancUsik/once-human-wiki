# Crazy Hayden/Steady Flow

Steady Flow[]
Hayden Kilgore, Head of the Marauders
Highland Residential Zone, South Iron River

This place will make a good stronghold. We should hold onto it. Those places behind us, including the water towers, farms, and cluster of buildings, can be used to accommodate survivors and store food. We should put on a righteous appearance, describe a beautiful vision, and attract any fleeing by the road. Then we will become an organized and disciplined survivor stronghold. Every day, people go out in search of food, so there are plenty of victims.
As long as the gate of the stronghold is open to everyone, we will have a steady stream of food, one by one, jumping right into my stomach...
And when my loyal servants learn to release their own desires, then those obedient subordinates will receive their own holy rewards...
