The Bald Cypress is a VERY large tree found in the Broken Delta, easy for the player to spot as its gargantuan size can be seen from across the map. Similarily to the Dracaena it can provide a large amount of Logs, but this tree is typically felled for a chance to receive a Fetch-A-Lot Bunny.

Tips[]
When felling a Bald Cypress use any pickaxe for a chance to receive a Fetch-A-Lot Bunny. You will not receive one using a rock (no tool) or chainsaw.
