Greywater Kid
I first met Hot Dog when I was in Blackfell a few years ago. At the time, he was a bit of a layabout. He seemed to just take each day as it came, just like most of these kids who never knew a life before Stardust.
Back then, Ted Holt had disappeared the iron gates of the White Cliff for many years. The Union was in absolute chaos, but people still remembered the name Holt. Because of that, the kid always did ok.
I took him out for beer and pizza a few times (he returned the favor once or twice, too), and he happened to share a few things about the Holt family's affairs. I went over the the ruins, found some old documents, some jewelry, machine parts, and so on, and I sold them for a decent profit. I sent Hot Dog his share, but he never wrote me back.
The last I heard, Hot Dog had been taken by Dennis Mobley to a new stronghold. Supposedly, he's really cleaned up his act, and is hard at work.
