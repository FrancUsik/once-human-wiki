Going Home[]

Mommy, Daddy, it's Lily. I lost my phone and had to borrow a woman's to send this message. I'm sorry, I sneaked out to buy a toy at the store, but something happened here.
Please come pick me up, I'm starting to get scared. All the adults are running around in a panic, and I can see the sky in the distance is as blue as the grapes at home.
I want to go home. Mommy and Daddy, if you come pick me up, don't wear blue!!! They hate blue here. Blue people will be thrown out, even if they hold on to the door and refuse to let go, people will break their fingers to make them leave. I want to go home!
