Uncle[]
Man: Who is it?! Who, who are you?
Caretaker: Calm down, it's me. I look after you. Do you remember?
Man: Ah, ah, the nurse! Of course I remember! You, you scared me! I thought a stranger had broken in here...
Caretaker: It's okay... There's nothing worth taking from here anymore anyway. Are you hungry?
Man: A little... Also, my diaper needs to be changed... Can you help me?
Caretaker: Wait a minute and I'll help you with that. By the way, I also found a little food: some candy. Would you like some?
Man: Candy?! Oh wow! You're made an old man very happy today!
Caretaker: Then close your eyes. Just close your eyes and you can have the candy.
Man: Sure, sure!
