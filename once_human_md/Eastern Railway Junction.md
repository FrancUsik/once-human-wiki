History[]
After Starfall, the Eastern Railway Junction became of the the most important shelters in Broken Delta, with hundreds of survivors fleeing to the junction. The settlement lived under the leadership of Owen Hicks, who taught the survivors how to defend themselves against Deviants, Stardust contamination, and Rift Entities. The settlement fell after being attacked by Rosetta, who, after making a public showing of murdering Owen, took most of the remaining survivors to an unknown location &#91;1&#93;.
