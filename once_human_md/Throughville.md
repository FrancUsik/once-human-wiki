Door Challenge[]
She does not knock, but here, she can be heard.
If you happen to stumble across this log, please keep quiet about it. These doors are very peculiar, as I'm sure you've already discovered. Please follow the following rules, they are designed to ensure your personal safety.

The blue door is always safe. Whenever you find yourself in danger, step through the blue door, if you can.
A door is a panel mounted on a frame that can be opened and closed. Each frame should only have one door. Please make sure the doorway you pass through only has one door.
If you see frames with three different colors appear at the same time, don't go through the middle frame.
There are no black and white doors here. If you see a black and white door, stay away from it.
To begin the Strange Inscription Challenge, locate the portal at the top of the building under construction (6439,-5153).
Once Players are teleported to the challenge location, interact with the scarecrow. This will cause the doors will light up in different colors. To solve the puzzle, first go through the blue door, then the green door, then the yellow door. If done correctly, all the doors stop glowing, and Players will find a loot crate in the middle of the area.
