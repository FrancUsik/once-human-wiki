Characteristics[]
The Rime Frost Elite Deviant retains much of her original human form, with her clothing still intact though tattered. She has transformed into a humanoid figure composed of shimmering ice flakes, her pale body fracturing like broken glass with every movement. Despite her eerie appearance, she strives to preserve beauty, seeking to craft a beautiful ending to her story.

Behavior[]
Rime Frosts behave similarly to the Mother of Life Elite Deviant—initially lethargic, pacing slowly around their territory. Once provoked, Rime Frosts will shake violently, their heads glowing red, before leaping into the air above their prey to commence their attack. They can summon a barrage of translucent orbs that rain down from the sky and can also summon smaller Deviants to join their offensive.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, focus your attacks on her mini-fridge head.
