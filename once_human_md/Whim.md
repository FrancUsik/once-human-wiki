Summary[]
A Whim is a special status effect applied to a character when Sanity drops to 50% and the character becomes Disturbed. Whims applied via Disturbed have both negative/adverse and positive/beneficial effects. Whim Potions are Consumables which apply a specific Whim to a character, Whims applied in this way generally have a "more positive/beneficial than negative/adverse" effect.
All Whims are Status Effects, not all Status Effects are Whims.
The current Whims applied to a character (if any) and their details can be viewed by opening your Backpack and clicking on the Sanity icon. When a character has Whims the Sanity icon is decorated with a small number indicating how many Whims are currently applied. A character can have, at-most, six Whims at once, when the maximum is reached and a new Whim would be applied the new Whim will replace an existing Whim.
Whims dissipate after a predetermined amount of time. Special consumables can cure you of your Whims.
