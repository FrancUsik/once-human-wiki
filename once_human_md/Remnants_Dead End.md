# Remnants/Dead End

Dead End[]
Velna Zimmerman, Warehouse Manager
Greenlake Hill, West Chalk Peak
December 7, ▮▮32
No, it doesn't work. We've tried every pickling method we can think of and still, we can't get those blue spots from the food. We've tried soaking, baking, and steaming, but what we ended up with was so disgusting that no one was willing to taste it... We have no idea what to do now.
Our food stocks are running low. Less than a quarter of the grain we harvested this year is edible. Far from enough. Even if we halve everyone's rations, we still need at least double our current food stocks to feed the whole of Greenlake Hill. There are hundreds of us! What now? Trade with those Tall Grass hunters to the east? Even supposing they were willing to help, they don't have that much food either. There's only one alternative left to us now...
