Summary[]
Bounce is a passive weapon status which causes bullets to ricochet off the target and hit other enemies. If there are no other enemies, the bullet will hit the original target again.
Bounce hits random enemies within 15m radius, then bounces again; each bounce deals DMG equal to 40% of Weapon DMG. If no target is available, bounce to the environment. This effect is non-element. The addition damage can cause crit damage, hit weakspots, and will decay with distance.
