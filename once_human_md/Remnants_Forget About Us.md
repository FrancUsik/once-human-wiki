# Remnants/Forget About Us

Forget About Us[]

Erin is gone. What stands before me is a small grave--it belongs to her mother, though there is no name on it.
I should have come to her sooner, I should have spoken for them at the meeting, but... I'm such a coward. I don't deserve to stand in Erin's presence, nor do I deserve to know where she went. Peace be with you, my dear. Please forget about Tall Grass, forget about us. You're too good for this world.
