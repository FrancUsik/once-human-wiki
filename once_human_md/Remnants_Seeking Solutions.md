What I am trying to tell you is that securing Deviations is not as easy as you seem to think.
Please, honorable and wise Captain Dominquez II-S0012, listen carefully to this poor, ignorant scientist who has not slept for days! Deviations are the materialization of human thoughts caused by Stardust decay. Do you understand what that means? It means that whatever's on your mind, no matter what, a flying horse or a pig on a unicycle, once the Stardust decays inside you, that horse or that pig will materialize in front of your eyes.
Now,, you may think that a horse or a pig should be quite easy to deal with. Indeed, if it were only one horse or pig, a hunter with a shotgun could resolve the issue very quickly. The problem is that no one knows how many possibilities the human mind has! The human mind is no less mysterious than Stardust. God only knows what things people can dream up. I'm sure you'd be amazed by the horrors this species can imagine, not to mention the untamed abilities they might posses.
Now, I hope you understand the severity of the situation. Securing Deviations requires careful consideration. There must be a general solution to our problem, but I need time.
