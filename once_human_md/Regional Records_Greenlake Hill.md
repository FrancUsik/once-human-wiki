# Regional Records/Greenlake Hill

Greenlake Hill[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
I was once a frequent visitor to Greenlake Hill, which was the biggest and most bustling community in the entire region... before the Starfall. I still remember the neon lights shimmering in the midnight, and the bars resonating with music and lively chatter until dawn. It was like a hidden gem in this secluded mountain area.
To our surprise, we found that the Survivors have established a strong shelter in Greenlake Hill, taking advantage of the steep terrain and the expansive views. With a large population and abundant resources they maintained significant influence over the entire Chalk Peak region for several years following the Starfall.
However, they seemed to have developed a peculiar system of governance, resembling a matriarchy, with several women holding the power, and their decisions were often far from wise.
The shelter, unfortunately, didn't make it to our arrival, falling apart due to internal corruption and external threats. The surviving residents dispersed: some sought refuge in Tall Grass (and it was from them we learned valuable information about this place), some were captured by Rosetta, and some even transformed into Marauders. There are reports of some going west, becoming pioneers on the plains.
