Souvenir Seller
Claire likes it when people call her "Auntie Claire." She's so maternal, but she never had her own kids, as far as I know.
I've had a few run-in with Claire over the years. She would always try to convince me to go risking my neck to go retrieve some useless piece of junk or other. Old photos, books with pages missing, electronic devices that do not turn on, kids' dolls with a limb missing... She saw value in all that old world stuff, I suppose.
I don't know Claire very well, to be honest. I don't understand why she insists on driving around in that rickety old pickup truck, searching for scrap to try and cell. Any little piece of human civilization, you can bet she'll be interested.
I don't understand it, but I respect it.
