Next month, I have to pay for Lily's dance lessons, but I don't have any money left... I can only pray this year's grapes will be bought at a good price.
How on Earth can I tell Andi that dance classes are just to unaffordable for a family like ours? She's so stubborn, she would rather work on the farm in the morning, work as a waitress in town in the afternoon, and work as a dishwasher at night than let Lily go without dance classes! Personally, I'd be happier with an ordinary life on the farm.
