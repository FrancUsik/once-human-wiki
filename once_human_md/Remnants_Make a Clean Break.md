Yeah, I recognize her. She's that woman explorer, a former local and the daughter of James Cooper who ran Chalk Peak Refinery before Starfall. He wasn't so successful with that business. I don't know what her intentions are with her so-called rediscovery, and I certainly don't want to know. I also don't recommend getting involve with "the Union." Mr. Greenlake is exactly what it is. We're struggling here, but at least we're surviving.
Get rid of that woman. Don't listen to her nonsense. If she still insists on coming in... Shoot her. Don't hesitate.
