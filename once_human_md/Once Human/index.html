<h1 id="once-human">Once Human<a class="headerlink" href="#once-human" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>There have been countless organizations secretly researching the origin of species and civilizations in human history. The most successful organization in modern times is the Rosetta, whose predecessor was the Rosetta Institute established in 1967 by a French human historian Professor Rachael-Pierre-Luberni, who discovered the Rosetta Stone. Rosetta was dedicated to the study of pre-human civilization and pan-cosmology. Then it gradually became a multinational giant in the communication and information industry in public perception, and secretly extended all around the world. Professor Luberni devoted himself to the research on the evolution of ancient human civilizations in his early years. He believed that in human history, there was a civilization that clearly transcended the boundaries of human thinking and ability at that time. Exploring the secrets behind these civilizations would help mankind bring new changes to the modern civilization that had been completely stagnant. With the support of his friend and collaborator Samuel Lowe, Luberni obtained the Rosetta Stone in 1967 and deduced the material from it that did not belong to the Earth.
After extracting the substance, some of the researchers who did not take strict protection were infected and mutated. This substance was the Stardust that would bring catastrophe in the future. It turned out that they have appeared on the earth a long time ago and affected human beings. At the urging of Samuel, Luberni launched Rosetta's space physics project. They reorganized the Rosetta Society into the Rosetta Technology Group and increased funding to Nalcott University in order to conduct their research. In secret, they led the "Silver Key Project",  trying to open and strengthen the influence of heterospace on Stardust.</p>
<p>A few years later, the project "Silver Key" entered the final stage. The core laboratory of  Rosetta located under the Nalcott city activated the quantum tunneling apparatus, trying to open up the superposition space connecting the heterospace. With the dazzling flash, a spherical bubble gradually appeared above the target area, and a large number of unprecedented energy fluctuations dissipated from the quantum tunneling apparatus. It was initially indistinguishable to humans, so the sleeping Stardust was instantly activated and began to infect, multiply, and spread. Then the Nalcott City incident occurred, and a large number of creatures and humans were infected  and gradually turned into monsters. The Rosetta organization still had time to close the "Silver Gate" to end this catastrophe, but its management, especially Samuel Lowe, was unwilling to stop it. This disaster proved that they have been fighting in the right direction, and it was important for them to hold the key to the future firmly. Having achieved energy control, Rosetta actually mastered the way to control Stardust. They chose to cut ties with governments around the world, allowing the stardust to wreak havoc and even lead it to spread. This also led to the collapse of humanity in the ensuing 30 years.
The collapse of the world did not end Rosetta's ultimate goal, but instead made them achieve unprecedented results. They deeply integrated with stardust and heterospace energy, then gave birth to a new type of human being called Meta-Humans. The Meta-Humans had physical qualities far beyond that of normal humans and can control extraordinary powers. The nine most important Meta-Humans called “The Nine”，which means the flesh of God.
However, Rosetta could not destroy the free will of human beings. Several members of The Nine and technicians escaped from Rosetta and formed the organization "Mayfly" to fight against Rosetta's conspiracy, Until now, they keep helping the human who are struggling to survive. They also try to save the Meta-Humans samples from Rosetta, inviting them to join the mayfly to grow their organization. Our player is one of the rescued Meta-Humans.</p>

<p>ABOUT THE GAME[]</p>
<p>Featuring a new weird style, we are committed to creating a unique, grand, and eerie open-world game set in a post-apocalyptic environment.
We have endeavored to bring Meta-Humans into a world ravaged by a horrendous calamity through scenes, characters, narratives, and other elements. It is a future where grotesque monsters and deformed mutations of unknown origins dominate our world, while our civilization, the fruit of human ingenuity, crumbled overnight, succumbing to distorted evolution. The whole environment had been transformed into Impasse due to the Stardust pollution.
The new weird genre has been reconciling the contradiction between science’s rationality and unexplored mysteries. However, the endeavor of reconciliation is precisely where the genre’s charm lies, as it keeps swinging back and forth between one end and the other.
This becomes our source of inspiration in terms of artistic style. We attempt to bring the products of high-level scientific technologies, representing the absolute rationality of human civilization, the beautifully eerie organisms of unidentified sources, and unnatural phenomena into collision, providing our players with powerful visual spectacles.
We have great faith in the tenacity of human subjectivity from the outset. Surviving and thriving over the total annihilation wrought by the cataclysm, we believe that humans would eventually develop a new evolution route for biological forms and scientific technologies by exploring the most incredible catastrophe humans have met so far. Hence, our world is comprised of scientific establishments, the Cradle device that contains the aberrant and escalates human physical strength, and the Veil of Tranquility resisting organic pollution that erodes human sanity. This is a ground-breaking era of human evolution.</p>
<p>Timeline[]
The events of Once Human take place in a distant future, long after humanity’s peak age of exploration and space expansion. While official sources keep the setting deliberately vague, in-game references — such as the monument at Camp Igloo in the Way of Winter expansion — provide concrete dates placing humanity’s activities in the 2300s.
This page outlines the chronological timeline of events based on known lore and in-game evidence.</p>
<p>📜 Pre-Starfall Era (1967–2361)[]
Samuel Lowe, Luberni obtained the Rosetta Stone in 1967 after several decades humanity had reached a spacefaring age, expanding across the Earth’s extremes and reaching into the stars. Colonization and exploration missions were active well into the 2300s.</p>
<p>December 17, 2311 – Ethan Parker  “Civilization is meaningless without humans, so we arrived and were able to plant our flag here.”  → A sign in the Agate Tundra Area (Camp Igloo) records the establishment of a human presence in the region.
January 14, 2361 – Olivia Bennett  “We are about to leave, but the mankind’s courage and resolution will be witnessed and remembered by stars.”  → Suggests the conclusion of a colonization/expedition effort, with humanity at its peak of technological and exploratory power.</p>
<p>🌌 The Starfall[]
Triggered by Rosetta’s experiments with a device known as the Silver Gate.
The experiment connected Earth to Heterospace, unleashing an alien contamination known as Stardust.
Stardust reshaped living organisms, created Deviants, and destabilized ecosystems worldwide.
Civilization collapsed rapidly, ending humanity’s age of progress.</p>
<p>🌑 Collapse and Survival (~20–30 Years Before the Player)[]
Following Starfall, survivors splintered into isolated groups.
Mutations spread uncontrollably, leading to warped creatures, altered environments, and the emergence of Meta-Humans.
Monoliths and alien anomalies became fixtures of the new Earth.</p>
<p>🔥 Player’s Era[]
The game begins 20–30 years after the Starfall.
Players awaken as Meta-Humans, beings capable of surviving Stardust’s corruption.
The world is dominated by Deviants, twisted landscapes, and remnants of once-advanced human civilizations.
The player’s journey revolves around survival, rebuilding, and uncovering the truth behind Rosetta, Stardust, and the Silver Gate.</p>
