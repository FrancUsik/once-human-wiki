Island Getaway[]

High Banks, North Broken Delta

The ferry was delayed due to the fierce waves, but eventually, we made it safety to shore. This is a small island with only one airport in the west.
After checking in at the hotel, Peter started to feel better. We ordered two soft drinks at the observation deck overlooking the cliff, and enjoyed the tropical sunshine and beautiful scenery. The doctor says that it will take some time for his immune system to fully recover. But no mater, we've come fully prepared. Forget those stinking design drawings and plans, we're on vacation!
Peter wants to go surfing or diving near the beach in the east with me tomorrow, weather permitting. We saw the crystal blue sea on the ferry, and we instantly fell in love. I can't wait to get into the water. Oh! It's time to put away our luggage. I'll hide the key in this phone case.
