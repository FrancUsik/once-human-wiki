Characteristics[]
With marine radars in place of their heads, the Scout Elite Deviant is capable of unleashing explosive electromagnetic pulses and piercing sound waves. These abilities disrupt their victims’ nervous systems, inducing motor dysfunction and immense mental agony.

Behavior[]
Like their basic counterparts, Scouts are parasitized by Living Ice—sentient Chaosium crystals with a tenacious will to survive. Destroying them permanently requires exposure to high temperatures or defeating them twice in combat. When threatened or engaged, Scouts utilize three primary attacks:

Electromagnetic Pulses: Generates seeking orbs that home in on foes, detonating on impact.
Snowballs: Forms and hurls frosty projectiles at targets.
Physical Attacks: Uses their icy limbs to bash enemies in close range.
Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for their radar head.
