Hey bro. There's something that's been really bothering me lately.
You've heard of color blindness, right? You know, that thing where a person has some kind of problem with their brain (or is it their eyes?) that makes it impossible for them to distinguish between certain colors. But have you ever heard of "number blindness"?
I'm starting to suspect that I'm coming down with a serious case of "number blindness," and here's why. So, we took receipt of a batch of fertilizer the other day, and it was stamped with a date from the year 2118! A hundred years in the future, can you believe it? James Tilly was the one who delivered it, so I gave him a clobbering, and asked him exactly what he thought he was playing at.
But James didn't know what I was talking about, he just kept insisting the bag was stamped with the year 2018, just like it should be.
We stood there arguing about this like a pair of idiots, until I finally called my wife over, and got her to tell me once and for all if that bag was stamped with the year 2018 or 2118. Well, she said that it was stamped with the year 1818, and that REALLY knocked me for six, let me tell you.
I tried to just forget all about it, but I seem to be getting worse. Now, it's started happening not just with numbers, but with words too...
