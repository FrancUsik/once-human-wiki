Make sure Nini takes her medication on time, I'll be home soon, and we can celebrate her 7th birthday together.
How has she been doing? Remember, she might bite her tongue when she goes into convulsions.
Don't apply for any more medication. We already exceeded the limit last month. If we apply for any more, they'll force Nini to take a health examination. And if she doesn't pass...
There are still some medications produced before the Starfall scattered around. Corol III and I will try to search for the medications during out ground operations. If we find any, we'll bring them back.
