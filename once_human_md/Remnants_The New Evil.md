Dennis Mobley still won't leave that damned oil in Blackfell. Stubborn old fool. Everyone but him can see that the place is too polluted. It's only a matter of time before the northern oil wells are exhausted. But, what should we do next? Keep looking for a new, unpolluted oil field? Nah, the age of oil and gas has passed. Rosetta had shown us a future in which humanity can rely only on Stardust. Things didn't pan out too well for Rosetta in the end, but their core idea was a good one. Stardust can provide a new energy source. Why not look to the future?
