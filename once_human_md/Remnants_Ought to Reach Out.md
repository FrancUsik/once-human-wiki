Those fools! All it takes is a couple good harvests, and everyone's starting to relax and let down their guard... Why can't anyone see the danger?
It's been four years since Silvershore Resort fell, and Rotten Saddle is surely next.We're running out of allies. All we've got left are those scheming poachers from Tall Grass. It's been over a year since anyone's been to the Eastern Railway Junction. We're living in a bubble. Cutting ourselves off has certain advantages, I guess, but humans are a cooperative species.
The Matriarchs know exactly what they're doing. Greenlake slowly cutting itself off from the world, and people are more and more reluctant to venture out and make contact with outsiders. Maybe this is the best survival strategy, I don't know. But I worry about what all this isolation is doing to us. I worry that it's making us somehow.. less human?
I just wish there were people around here who understood what I mean.
