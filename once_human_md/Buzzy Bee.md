The Buzzy Bee is a territory deviation. When placed inside of an Isolated Securement Unit in the player's territory, it will be able to increase the rate at which player planted crops will become mutated.

Deviation Skill[]
Deviated Gardening: Increase the mutation chance of planted crops. The higher the Deviant Energy level, the higher the mutation chance.
Crops planted on the player's territory, either in Planter Boxes or Loamy Soil, will be affected by the Buzzy Bee, as it flies around randomly selecting plants and pollinating them, increasing the chances of the selected crop becoming mutated, turning it into the deviated version.

Obtaining[]
Can be found in and around farmland in the wilderness. Locations where the Buzzy Bee has been successfully captured in the wild include:

Sunbury Farm
Evergreen Vineyard
Brewery Estate
Citrus County
Sutherland Vineyard
Dayton Wetlands
Winding Ridge Farmland
Iron River

Story[]
"Deviation O-013 is a toy made from molded plastic. It's designed to resemble a cartoon bee with bright colors. It has a pair of decorative wings on its back and four sturdy little wheels at the bottom. On the Deviation's base there is a hidden battery slot that can accommodate 2 AA alkaline batteries, as well as an on/off switch. When this compartment is opened, researchers found the following message, written in golden cursive: "A little helper for William, the future farmer. From ■■■■■."
Deviation O-013's main trait is its effect on plants in its vicinity. The Deviation can be "activated" by inserting batteries into the slot and flipping the switch. Once activated, the Deviation's wings will begin to vibrate, and it will take off. (Researchers believe that the Deviation's wings are in fact purely decorative. It remains unclear, however, exactly through what mechanism the Deviation is able to fly, if not by using its wings.) The Deviation will then be immediately drawn to the nearest artificially cultivated plant it can find, hover in midair, and generate an invisible energy field between 2-3m in diameter. This energy field accelerates the growth of all crops within its range. Observed effects of the Deviation's energy field include:

The growth of bacteria and fungal species is slowed.
Crop metabolic processes are accelerated, leading to slightly increased growth speed.
Common insect pest species are repelled.
Pollination success rate is slightly increased.
Humans and animals exposed to the energy field are unaffected.
Securement Procedures:Do:
Secure Deviation O-013 in a Level IV high-value item securement chamber lined with 10mm lead plating.Do Not:
Conduct experiments with the Deviation in open spaces."
