# Remnants/Our Mission

Our Mission[]
White King, Grand Priest
Furnace Lair, East Chalk Peak
September 12, ▮▮31
All who seek refuge among us are considered family, and all followers, regardless of position, are treated as equals.
Rosetta has their "basic workers," but how do these individuals differ from mere slaves? The Union cast aside the unskilled as "outsiders," refusing to acknowledge them as their own. Meanwhile, in the western region, countless gangs within the Furutake Gumi barely scraped by, while their superiors indulge in luxuries like fresh dairy, fine wines, and bread.
Even after the Starfall, humanity continues to suffer. Stardust must once again purify the lingering corruption. Our mission is to... bring them back.
