# Remnants/Past It

Past It[]
Klein Warren, Mayor of Tall Grass
Tall Grass Inn, East Chalk Peak

Earl Tennyson can no longer handle the job of a Gatherer. He's old, and he's sow. His wild fruit haul last month was less than half of what a typical laborer brings in. I'm just surprised he hasn't had an "accident" yet. If his performance doesn't pick up next month, I'll have to consider giving him an honorable way out.
And then there's Mark Tyner - still refusing to do what he's old. He's as stubborn as his sister. He's still hung up about how Mary-Ann got killed during the Silent Beast op. He's got it in his head that it's my fault. Well, I don't give a damn. Let him have his delusions. A few more weeks in the basement should bring him round. If not, then, maybe a little introduction to the Silent Beast will do the trick...
