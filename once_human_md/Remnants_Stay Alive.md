Denise went north, and we have to wait for her. Yes, that's the only answer I have. Before Denise comes back, we have to find a way to keep living.
Sell everything we can, except for the resort. Vehicles, collectibles, personal property. Whatever. We still haven't finished paying off the workers, and I've been trying to figure out how to repay those bank loans. No, I won't call my daughter. I don't want to disturb Denise. If there's something important, she'll reach out to me.
I'm sorry I can't make any promises. Will Ted Holt lend us a helping hand? Even if he does, will it stop Rosetta from taking everything away from us? I don't know. All I can say is, don't give up. Stay alive.
