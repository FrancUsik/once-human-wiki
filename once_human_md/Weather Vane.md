Characteristics[]
The Weather Vane’s head has been replaced by a nautical vane that no longer shifts harmlessly with the wind. Instead, it generates and controls freezing gales capable of immobilizing enemies and inflicting frostbite. These cold gusts also grant the Weather Vane unnatural agility, making them formidable foes in combat.

Behavior[]
Like their basic counterparts, Weather Vanes are parasitized by Living Ice—sentient Chaosium crystals with an extraordinary will to survive. They can only be permanently defeated by exposure to high temperatures or being knocked down a second time. When engaged, Weather Vanes use the following attacks:

Freezing Gale: Generates frigid, damaging winds using their propeller-like head.
Snowballs: Forms and hurls frosty projectiles at targets.
Physical Attacks: Uses their icy limbs to bash enemies in close range.
Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the Weather Vane’s propeller head.
