Someone else has already picked the place clean. I wasn't expecting that.
Someone from the west, I'm sure of it. It looks like they even set up a semi-permanent camp, drawing weird mountain shaped symbols all over the walls (the mark of their organization?). But still, they chose to abandon this place rather than stay and defend it. They must have lacked the proper defensive gear. The trouble is, they didn't leave me a damn thing. We're short on construction materials, tools... pretty much everything. looks like we'll have to get a shipment from the underground base.
