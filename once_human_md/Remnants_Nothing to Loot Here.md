Damn it... And damn that blasted Cyril... Why didn't he tell us there were ghosts here?! He said there was nothing worth scavenging here, but I didn't believe him.
Vida and Walter went in and never came out. They disappeared without a trace, no matter how much we shouted, there was no response. It's as if they were swallowed by those dilapidated cabins. I saw... something, lurking around, barely visible. Damn it, we were planning to make this place a new base, but now, we better run quickly!
