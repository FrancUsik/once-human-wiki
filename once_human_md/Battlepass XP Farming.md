Obtaining XP[]
There are several different ways to gain XP for levelling up the Battlepass, this page talks about common methods to quickly farm XP. For general information about gaining Battlepass XP, see the Battlepass Page.

Salt Farming[]
At the start of a Phase the easiest way to passively gain Battlepass XP is to gather Sea Water and craft Salt at a Stove. Each maximum batch of salt (99) grants the player 10 Battlepass XP

Crafting Fishing Rods[]
Players that are prepared to place down plenty of supply workbenches can reap the rewards from crafting Fishing Rods. Taking 30 seconds each to craft and rewarding the player with 6 Battlepass XP each, players can easily rack up 30 Battlepass XP every 2 minutes and 30 seconds with just one supplies workbench.

Refinery Farming[]
Refinery runs will last 5 minutes, and net the player 2 Battlepass XP per enemy defeated, and an additional 39 Battlepass XP per enemy boss defeated. On average, there are 3 bosses, bringing in 117 Battlepass XP alone. This compounds substantially when players defeat the other ~40 enemies, resulting in a total of ~200 Battlepass XP per run.
