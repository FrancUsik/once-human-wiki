I can't believe I actually got the job! From now on, I'm a fully-fledged Rosetta employee, thank you very much! I know that, at first, I'll probably just get given the boring, simple tasks. Sampling, testing, things like that. But that's ok. This is a fresh start! Good jobs in multinational companies don't come around every day, especially for small-town doctors like me. The only criticism I do have is with Rosetta's safety protocols. In the training, the seemed like they care much more about protecting their scientific data than, you know, people. Or the environment, for that matter. I'm sure Rosetta's experiments are very important and their results are extremely precious... but still. Data isn't more important than life.
