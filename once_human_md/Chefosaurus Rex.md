Summary[]
Chefosaurus Rex is a Territory Deviation that assists with Cooking. Any food Chefosaurus Rex cooks will gain a 10% boost to effects.

How To Get[]
Opportunity to obtain upon completion of the side task Thereâ€™s a Dragon There, acquired from Lowe (5728,-6564) in Meyer's Market.
Chance to spawn in Securement Silo - PHI (5142,-2943) in Iron River.
Abilities[]
Culinary Genius; Increases your cooking proficiency. The higher the Deviant Energy level, the greater the proficiency increase.

Tips[]
Originally Chefosaurus Rex would teleport to cooking stations. This was changed and currently the deviation will walk from their current position to the cooking station instead of teleporting. Any food produced before Chefo arrives will NOT have a bonus applied. For this reason it is best to queue up a large stack of something like boiled water ahead of other items and then cancel it once Chefo arrives (ensuring remaining items in queue gain a bonus.)
