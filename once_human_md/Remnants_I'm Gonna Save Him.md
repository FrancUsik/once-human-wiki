# Remnants/I'm Gonna Save Him

I'm Gonna Save Him[]
Korak Raman
Please, look after Andy for me. He is in the early stages of corrosion, and his condition is very unstable.
There are too many Deviants out there, so be extra careful. The church should be safe for now.
On my way, I heard from a passing Mayfly that there is a Rift Entity in the Monolith to the northwest, and the "Source" there can heal those afflicted by the corrosion - what an incredible power!
For the sake of Andy, I must go there. He is the only family I have left. I must save him, whatever it takes.
