Characteristics[]
Eclipse Crocodiles have become vital conduits between land and sea, dispersing Stardust to every corner of the world. However, when the level of Stardust in an Eclipse Crocodileâ€™s body exceeds a certain threshold, it causes deformities in the mouth and massive Stardust growths across the body and tail, transforming the creature into the Corrupted Crocodile variant.

Behavior[]
Corrupted Crocodiles exhibit significantly increased mobility in their previously short limbs, allowing them to traverse land and greatly expand their range of activity. Once they spot prey, they aggressively pursue it.

Strategy[]
Focus your attacks on their head or mouth, or target the bulbous Stardust deformities on their bodies for maximum effect.

Locations[]
Corrupted Crocodiles can be found in many locations throughout Nalcott, particularly near bodies of water.

Drops[]
Corrupted Crocodiles can be harvested for meat, which can be dried or used in a variety of recipes.

Notes[]
Amphibious and aquatic creatures were among the earliest to transform into Eclipse seed species, likely due to Stardust spreading rapidly through ocean currents.
