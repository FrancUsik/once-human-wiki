Beyond Repair[]
Keim I-S6007, Senior Supervisor
Gaia Military Base, East Chalk Peak
May 10, ▮▮33
Sergeant Basil IV-S6007 has displayed signs of emotional instability on three separate occasions in recent weeks. I'm afraid I cannot approve his mental health evaluation for this quarter. I'm aware that he's a highly respected, decorated veteran - but he's still a fourth-generation Nev. The fourth-gen models have been showed to have a 4.73% emotional defect rate. Unfortunately, it looks like Basil IV-S6007 is part of that 4.73%.
We will arrange for his transfer and provide all the appropriate care before disposal, as usual.
