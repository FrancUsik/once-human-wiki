# Securement Log (1)/Targetless

Targetless[]
Wilbur II-S2147, Rosetta Agent
Silvershore Resort, Southwest Chalk Peak

There was an unexpected incident during the Star-0813 Securement Op, which resulted in the unfortunate death of senior agent Alive III-S2147. The Deviant (Star-0813-1) responsible has been repelled, but its strength far exceeded our initial estimates, and our weapons were unable to completely annihilate it. We are unable to pinpoint Star-0813's exact whereabouts with the equipment we currently have on hand, but we believe it remains close to the target location. We are now preparing to retreat. The Securement Op has been suspended.
