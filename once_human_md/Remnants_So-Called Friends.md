Dave has been in a bad mood recently. The same miserable expression every day. He won't speak to me, even if I try to comfort him. I'm worried. He and Simon's gang have been spending way too much time together. I don't know what they do all day...
That Simon Meyer is a real troublemaker. No matter what problem the stronghold is facing, you can bet he'll be the first to complain. He always makes a point of disagreeing with Mr. Owen Hicks. Even if some of his opinions do seem quite reasonable, how can he contradict Mr. Owen Hicks? And in a public forum!? I have to tell Dave to stay away from these so-called friends of his. And if he doesn't listen, I might have to go talk to Mr. Irving...
