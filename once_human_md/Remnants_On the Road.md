On the Road[]
Sierra Harrington, Traveler
Dayton Hospital, North Dayton Wetlands
October 28, ▮▮35
Erin insisted on spending the night in this old ruin. The house is run down and overgrown, even the walls themselves feel like they are about to collapse. I reckon the place has been abandoned for at least a decade.
I asked Erin why she didn't want to go to the hospital next door. The hospital still looks structurally sound at the very least. And maybe we could've found a proper bed to sleep in. Somewhere a bit less damp to rest for the night. But she just laughed and called me an idiot.
"If it looks good to us," she said, "then it also looks good to the bandits, the beasts, and even the Deviants. Life is though right now, but we've got keep going."
For dinner, we opened a can of baked beans from 2018. It expired eighteen years ago, but was still delicious. It's been a long time since I've eaten so much. And as I lay there by the warm campfire after dinner, my belly full, my mind started t wander. I started thinking about how nice it would be to fall asleep with Erin in my arms...but she's been coughing for the past few days. I hope she's okay. We don't have any medicine or any means of finding any.
