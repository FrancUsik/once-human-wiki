I've taken all my psychological counseling, and yet I still felt a distinct sense of discomfort when entering the ruins of this settlement.
Hundreds of people lived here before the Starfall. Who knows how long they lasted? Were they annihilated instantly? Or did they slowly perish, after a long period of agony and despair? Strictly speaking, they can't even be said to have died. Some of them still wander among those crumbling houses, twisted into all kinds of inhuman forms.
We have to wipe them all out. Even if they were once human beings, now they are just Deviants, formed after the Stardust reaction was halted. In theory, they are now no different from all the Stardust debris the litters the ground.
