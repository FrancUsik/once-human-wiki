Regional Records: Sutherland Chemical Plant[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Ms. Han told me in detail the story of the Sutherland Chemical Plant. She worked there as a warehouse supervisor when the Starfall hit and somehow managed to survive the initial attack by the Rift Entity, along with several colleagues. But what happened after that... isn't easy to write.
The plant workers were desperate and scared. They blamed the factory owners for the attack - not that there's anything they could've done to prevent it, of course. The Sutherland family were the ones who first brokered Rosetta's entry to the island. Driven to madness by their fear, the workers themselves dealt with the plant managers, brother Nelson and Donald Sutherland. Then, they turned their uncontrollable anger on the rest of the Sutherland family. Men, women, children, no one was spared...
It's been more than ten years, and Ms. Han was still on the verge of tears as she told me this story. She said that after witnessing all that destruction, she left the plant alone and headed out into the wilderness on foot. Somehow, despite the Stardust and circling Rift Entities, she managed to survive. Ms. Han has since never set foot in the chemical plat again, nor does she know what happened to the other workers.
There's no trace of life at the plant now, but from what they left behind, it seems Ms. Han was right. A group of humans used this place as a shelter after the Starfall. It looks like they managed to hold on for two years, one year, maybe even less. And it's easy to see why. There wasn't much in the way of food stores, and the land around the plant is completely barren even now. The poison of Stardust runs deep.
