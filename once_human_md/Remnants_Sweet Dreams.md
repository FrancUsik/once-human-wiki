Dad and Aunt have already "gone to sleep," both having drunk the wine I brought. Although they acted no different than usual, I knew they had detected everything. Dad's "goodnight" was so solemn, I was on the verge of breaking down as I walked out the door. If it wasn't for... I really wanted to pull out a gun and end it all.
Tomorrow, Cynthia will tell the kids that their grandparents have left. The food saved will allow us to hold on for a bit longer. But what about after that... Who will be next? I dare not think...
