# Once Human: RaidZone

Once Human: RaidZone is a standalone spinoff of the game that takes Once Human's PvP mechanics into a full-scale survival mode. Set in a lawless open world, RaidZone’s primary focus is ruthless player-versus-player combat, with the survival part of the game still intact. While PvP was always an aspect of Once Human, RaidZone makes it an even bigger part of the game. Gone are shared PvE goals, safe zones, or the exploration missions players are familiar with. Every player, structure, and piece of loot is fair game.

RaidZone Features[]
New Story[]
RaidZone will feature an entirely different story from the Endless Dream PvE scenario. There are multiple endings possible in each scenario depending on the size of The Hollow.

Scenario Progress[]
The Hollow is a unique place in the map that speeds up the realm destruction progress. Entering the Hollow drains Sanity, makes buildings suffer more Durability loss, and contains stronger enemies.
Resources, loots, and enemy drops in The Hollow are also better, with a chance of obtaining Realm Crystals.

Alternative Map[]
RaidZone takes place in the Broken Delta region with some minor changes. Every settlement or stronghold will include its own crates and may even have a chance to drop rare resources like Realm Fragments. This map will not include PvE instances such as Monoliths, Securement Silos, or Public Crisis Events.

Capped Level[]
All players in RaidZone begin at Level 50 with no innate supplies, blueprints, or mods.

Equipment, Memetics, and Deviants[]
Raidzone has a fixed and dedicated list of equipment, memetics, and deviations. These can used and unlocked as players gradually get stronger by acquiring more weapons and armor from looting throughout the game. There is no vehicle ownership either; players can operate abandoned or field-repaired vehicles. Nothing carries over from the main game; players won’t have their equipment, blueprints, Deviations, or mods. Players will have to unlock everything again in RaidZone. Progress in RaidZone doesn’t carry over to other game modes.

Loot Crate and Supply Drops[]
Supplies can be found all throughout the map and will be available to every player. Every loot crate in RaidZone is available to the first player who opens them. The spawn intervals of crates are:

Basic Supply Crate - Every 15 minutes
Intermediate Supply Crate - Every 1 hour
Advanced Supply Crate - Every 4 hours
Aerial supply drops are also loot crates that glow white and the player will have a high-chance of receiving Legendary gear or high-tier explosives.

Memory Chips Unlock Memetics[]
Every loot obtained in RaidZone will contain a Memory Chip. Memory Chips are used for building and unlocking Memetics to improve equipment and crafting.

Summon Manibus[]
Players will have the ability to summon Manibus through Deviations by collecting Realm Fragments. When Deviations are at full strength, summoning Manibus will deal huge damage to an area and open a massive Hollow, speeding up the realm destruction progress.

Building and Territory Restrictions[]
While each player can have up to three Territory Terminals, playing in RaidZone will have relocation disabled. Players can also destroy other players' territory structures. Buildings will gain full damage reduction buffs everyday from midnight to noon, server time.

Death[]
Dying will cause all collected items to drop and become lootable by any player in RaidZone. Player will remain vulnerable to attacks even when they are offline. Ensure safety by staying inside an enclosed building in your territory.
