Another night. I seem to have lost the ability to sleep, I'm tense, nervous, when I close my eyes, all I see are Hannah's blue pupils...
I flattered her when I first saw them: "Your eyes are so beautiful today, bluer than the sea." She didn't say a word, but just moved closer to me. When she jumped at me with all her teeth and nails, I didn't move, it was just lovers' play. But after than...
I hear a cat in the night now, I see the moon glowing between the sparse leaves of a tree to my left. I don't feel sleepy at all. I've reached it, reached my limit.
