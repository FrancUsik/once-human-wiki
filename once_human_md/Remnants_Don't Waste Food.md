Don't Waste Food[]
Robert Foster, Rosetta Auditor
Dayton Hospital, North Dayton Wetlands
September 6, ▮▮18
Someone has been stealing medicine from the stockroom... Macrodanin, furantoin, dexamethasone, glibenclamide, retinol... Not the usual stuff you'd expect a thief to take... Either this thief really knows her stuff, or this was an inside job. And I know that you're the one who's been helping her.
Hey, relax. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. I just wanted to let you know that you're bound to get found out sooner or later if you keep this up. As you know, the medical stockroom inventory list is filed every Thursday in the early morning, But, what you and that medic lady also need to know is that the audit department checks the inventory data 1 hour and 20 minutes before it is officially filed. That's how I noted the medicine had gone missing. But the way, the thief also place some stuff next to the statue in the square. You should check it out if you have time. Maybe they left something good.
And remember, if the locals send another gift of chicha, pâté or smoked bonito, don't just dump it in the swamp (please!). Put it all in garbage bags, then ti the bags with blue string. That way, someone will come along and collect it, and make sure it ends up in the right place.
