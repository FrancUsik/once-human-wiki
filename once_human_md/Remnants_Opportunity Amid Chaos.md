# Remnants/Opportunity Amid Chaos

Opportunity Amid Chaos[]

It was absolute chaos at the Railway Junction. The Black Cans were coming and going constantly. All night long there was gunfire, shouting, and crying. Is "Justice" Owen Hicks already dead? Maybe it's true. All this violence on the streets does suggest he's no longer in the picture.
Whatever the truth about Owen Hicks, this is an opportunity for us. The Black Cans couldn't get to us in Sunbury, and now they've established a presence at the Railway Junction. But they've gotten greedy, they've spread themselves too thinly... The Black Cans don't know about all those supply points and concealed warehouse that Owen built. And that means they're ours for the taking! And people, too. Anyone who wasn't captured by the Black Cans now belongs to us.
