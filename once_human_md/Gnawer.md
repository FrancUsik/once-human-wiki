Characteristics[]
As the Stardust spreads further into its host, a Charred Maniac will evolve into a Gnawer. By this stage, most human features have been stripped away, with only the torso still resembling its former human form. Once its bodily tissue is entirely consumed by Stardust, the Gnawer is driven by an insatiable urge to hunt other physical forms, allowing its Stardust to feed. This relentless hunger is, in part, what inspired the name “Gnawer.”

Behavior[]
The Gnawer’s primary drive is to spread Stardust—any lingering human instincts have long been forgotten. Gnawers exhibit extreme aggression toward any creature in their vicinity, typically attacking by tearing at their enemy’s flesh or spitting tissue fluid.

Strategy[]
Aim for the head. However, be aware that some Gnawers can still attack even after their head has been removed.

Locations[]
Gnawers are low-ranking enemies, commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Field Guide/Dangerous Entities[]
I - Secondary Evolution
As Stardust proliferates further into its host, a Charred Maniac will evolve into a Gnawer. At this point, most human features have been stripped away, with only the torso retaining its old human form.
Once its bodily tissue has been completely devoured by Stardust, the Gnawer is overcome with an insatiable drive to hunt own other physical forms, so its Stardust is able to feed.
It is, in part, after this insatiable hunger that the Gnawer were named.
II - Stardust Spreader
The Gnawer's strongest urge is to spread Stardust - any residual human instincts have already been long forgotten. Gnawers also display extreme aggression against any creature in their vicinity, and will generally attack by attempting to tear the enemy's flesh, or spitting tissue fluid.
