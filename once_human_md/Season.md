A Season defines the timeline of events such as start dates, end dates, phase periods, etc.

"Season Wipes" is the community term used to describe the mechanic where, upon season closure, player character progress is lost.
It is worth noting that the developers are fine tuning this mechanic based on player feedback. It is not true that "all" progress is lost, and, it's possible to carry some items into the next season. It is true though that player character level, home, etc are unrecoverable.

Spacetime Backpack[]
The Spacetime Backpack stores items from previous seasons, preventing them from being lost due to a season closure.
Upon season closure (or your election to move your character to a new server, whichever occurs first) all eligible items are moved into the Spacetime Backpack. Not all items are eligible, and eligibility rules are subject to change by season, scenario, or over time. For specifics of what items are eligible you should refer to in-game references.
For more details please see the Spacetime Backpack article.

Territory Blueprints[]
Upon season closure blueprints of your territories (primary territory and mobile territories) are automatically stored for retrieval.

Season Wipe Tips[]
Remember to craft any tools, weapons, and armor you may need to start the next season. Keep in mind that many items are level-locked, for example you can't equip a Tier V Rifle on a Lv.1 player character.
