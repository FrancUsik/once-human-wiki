# Remnants/Destruction and Redemption

Destruction and Redemption[]
Odelia Foster, Survivor
Rotten Saddle, South Chalk Peak
February 28, ▮▮27
The twins always said that Rotten Saddle would come to an end, and it looks like their prophecy is about to come true. The water tanks, suddenly started glowing blue. Some people blamed Bernard, who was guarding them. Still, terrorizing that poor man won't change the fact that Rotten Saddle will soon have no water. There's no telling how much longer the food will hold out, all we know is that the gruel is getting thinner by the day.
The mountains hold our salvation, or so the twins kept telling us. I'm no longer sure they're insane... David and Marcus, they may really be messengers from God, here to save us...
