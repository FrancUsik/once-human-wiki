# Remnants/Laila's Notes

Laila's Notes[]
Laila Gleming, Ex-Farmer
Deadsville, Middle Dayton Wetlands
May 6, ▮▮39
We sure were lucky to stumble across such a secure shelter out here in the Dayton Wetlands! Captain Denise  Cooper's records mentioned the location of a"town of the living dead" (her worlds, not mine), but those records date back almost twenty years. Amazingly, this place has somehow managed to remain uninfected by Stardust. Even more fortunately, we also ran into a few travel companions.
Claire comes from the north, and her car was loaded with some really weird shit... Collectible figurines? Tourist souvenirs? Neither Wells nor I had even seen anything like it. But still, Claire has been super kind and friendly. Long nights in the wilderness somehow seem a but less scary with her company.
Mr. Olson is from the Mudwater Stronghold. He's a messenger, on his way to Meyer Market. He doesn't seem like a very reliable employee, but he's not a bad guy, exactly.
As for Mr. Lowe... I can't say exactly what he is. He was already here when we arrived, sitting alone on that stool, drinking by himself. He didn't come talk to us, and he straight up ignored me when I said "hello" to him...  It's as if he is waiting for someone...
