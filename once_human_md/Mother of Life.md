Characteristics[]
The Mother of Life Elite Deviant retains more of its original human form than any other monster yet encountered. It was clearly female, with a tattered white dress still faintly recognizable. A jellyfish-like Deviation has replaced the woman’s head, obscuring her former appearance. Though they are only found in a few locations across Nalcott, these creatures are easily distinguishable by their subtle bioluminescent glow.

Behavior[]
The Mother of Life is relatively lethargic on approach, slowly pacing and emitting quiet, mournful moans. Despite her docile appearance, she can become highly aggressive when provoked.

Strategy[]
The Mother of Life is surprisingly resilient compared to other Elite Deviants, requiring more damage to defeat. Focus your attacks on her head to bring her down more efficiently.

Locations[]
You can find the Mother of Life in the following areas: 

Hearst Industries - Approx. (6076,-5986)
Greenlake Hill - Approx. (887,-4402)
Silvershore Resort - Approx. (132,-7248)
Notes[]
There are two named versions of the Mother of Life that players can encounter through the main storyline and sidequests:
“Eve” - The final boss in the LEA Research Lab Dungeon. (Note: Eve's behavior differs from the typical "Mother of Life" behavior outlined above.)
“Kelly” - Eve’s daughter and “The Glass Jellyfish” from the “Long Journey” quest.
