# Disassembly

Disassembly is the best way to obtain materials to upgrade your facilities, tools, weapons, and armor.

How to Disassemble[]
Disassembly requires a Disassembly Bench. 

Scraps[]
The process is straightforward, you go out into the world and pick up scrap materials you see laying about, or search for them in storage crates, or loot them from defeated enemies. Once you have scraps you can disassemble them in a Disassembly Bench to obtain materials you need for crafting and upgrades.
