Regional Records/Ricci Securement Point[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
This is no place for us. We're just a small expedition team. We have no hope against Rosetta troops, armed to the teeth with state-of-the-art gear... One thing is clear - Rosetta is just as strong as now as they were ten years ago. They've just been biding their time...
We managed  to hide from the patrol squads, and bedded down for the night in an abandoned camp, in the beast's shadow. it was a well-protected military encampment, with zero signs of Stardust erosion. There was also a two-story concrete building that looked like a command post or research center of some kind. Rosetta really got busy here before Starfall...
Anyway, this Rosetta stronghold seems to be in a period of temporary activity. They won't stay here permanently tough, I'm sure of it. They'll keep expanding into the rest of Nalcott. I still can't get my head round it. Rosetta are human! Why do they seem to be on the side of the Stardust? Pushing Nalott closer and closer to the brink... The Starfall and Rosetta are intimately connected - I'm sure of it. We have no idea what new horrors they're working on. But for as long as the Union is working to bring humankind together, you can be sure that Rosetta will stand in our way.
I've made a comprehensive assessment of the expedition's current strength, and determined that we won't be able to get away with a 5-man patrol. So, we made plans to leave under the cover of darkness instead. There's too much at stake. Can't be reckless.
