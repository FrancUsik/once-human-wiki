# Remnants/Adapting to My Copy

Adapting to My Copy[]

This is the fifth day, after, I was born. The training, today, is to, continue, journalism.
I tried, to use, a gun. But my, hands and feet, couldn't, coordinate. My fingers, cramped, and I, blew my, toe off. It's too hard, to control fifteen personalities, at the same time. My appetite, is still good. Eating, makes me the happiest. The fifteen of us, ate a whole deer. So good.
Today's reflection: where, am I, now? Does, the an called, Archer, still exist?
