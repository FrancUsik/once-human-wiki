Furnace Lair[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Since the Starfall, Chalk Peak has been a disquieting place, perpetually cast in gloom and terror. And this blasted place... no, this abandoned town is a perfect example of that.
Some really crazy things have happened here. A bunch of maniacs left some bizarre drawings on the walls, marks I couldn't even begin to describe... Those people must have been driven to insanity by Chalk Peak itself. I'm beginning to suspect that even I may have fallen under its strange influence... We must leave these endless, maddening mountains at once.
The locals call this place Furnace Lair, but no one can tell us how this name arose, or what it was like pre-Starfall. It's odd, almost as if the town appeared out of nowhere, or that all of their memories of what it was like before have been erased.
While keeping vigilant, we carried our further investigations but found no information about the town's past other than the marks left by those crazies. We can leave this page blank for now. Maybe we'll be able to find out more in the future.
