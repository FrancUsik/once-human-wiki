Welp. We've destroyed all the blue wine, and all traces that we've been staying here. And now, we'll have to move again. There's a powerful presences in the land. We just get through so much STUFF while we're here. It's not hard to defeat it (Me and Chester have done it several times), but we don't have a way to secure the thing properly, so it just keeps coming back.
So, we might as well just leave. It's back to Plan A. Head north and look for other survivors. Chester and I have been in hiding for so long, I don't even feel like a persona anymore.
