The local government has been reducing financial support for this facility for three consecutive years. We've been using a portion of the client's pensions as a temporary subsidy, but even so, at this rate, we won't be able to make ends meet by fall.
The hiring issue is staring us in the face. We can only offer extremely low wages, which doesn't attract professionals with proper nursing experience. We have to settle for less. Fortunately, the local population's income level is already low, and there are some children from poor families who haven't been properly educated. They are hard workers, and they don't ask for much in return. In fact, a girl is supposed to come for an interview this afternoon. An orphan, apparently. I wonder how long she will stay...
