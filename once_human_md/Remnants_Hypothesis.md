# Remnants/Hypothesis

Hypothesis[]
Donald Holder, Rosetta Medical Intern
Alkirk, North Iron River
June 12, ▮▮19
Listless eyes, pale complexion, cold skin, frayed nerves -- I've seen a lot of these symptoms recently.
The patients have all said they were frightened by Rosetta forces after running into them at night, but it's rarely that simple. Someone like William obviously isn't such a coward that the sight of Rosetta would reduce him to this. No, I suspect this is caused by some sort of airborne virus, and a highly contagious one at that. It's already infected people all across Alkirk. I'm sure in the right conditions, such a virus could cause heart palpitations in even the bravest person. These nighttime encounters are, I believe, just be a trigger in their already weakened bodies.
This is worth discussing with Dr. Kelvin. If my supposition is true, this is extremely serious! Dr. Kelvin said I was delusional before, but wait until he sees the evidence.
