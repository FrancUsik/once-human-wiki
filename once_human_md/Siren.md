Characteristics[]
The Siren Elite Deviant is a towering, pale, and decayed humanoid with a thin, bony frame, closely resembling that of a Glutton. Unlike the Glutton, however, the Siren’s limbs and torso are covered in barnacles and other water-induced growths. While the Glutton’s head is a flower-bud-like fissure, the Siren’s head features a full steel-frame signal tower extending upward from this fissure, acting as an extension of the entity.

Behavior[]
Sirens roam Nalcott on a slow, sacred pilgrimage, spreading the gospel of their “Elder Sisters.” They emit a continuous “song,” broadcasting an enigmatic and unfathomable signal. Once provoked, the Siren releases multiple translucent orbs that relentlessly seek out its aggressors.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the radio dishes that form the Siren’s “head.”

Trivia[]
Rumors suggest that humans afflicted by the Siren’s signal may have heard forbidden knowledge—messages never meant for human ears.
The Siren is portrayed as a boss in the “tutorial”
