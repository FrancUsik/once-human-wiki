My God, if just one tenth of the people flooding over the bridge right now were customers, we'd sell out everything in the store in no time flat. There must be a clearance sale going on somewhere nearby.
No, that's not right, otherwise they'd ll be heading in the same direction. There's too many people on the bridge, it's like a stampede. All those who make it over are heading every which way.
It's almost as if... No, I'm certain, they're fleeing something! I've gotta grab my stuff and go - out west. Anywhere. Now. Now!
