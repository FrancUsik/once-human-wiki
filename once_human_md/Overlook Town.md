From a distance, the old site looked almost completely intact. No signs of the Marauders. Keith and Amelia were both strongly in favor of exploring, but I decided not to take the rise. There are dark forces lurking in that place, I'm sure of it. Otherwise, the place would've been stripped clean of valuables long ago."

Summary[]
Overlook Town is located in the south of Dayton Wetlands at 6759,-5770. 

History[]
The Sutherland family had been investing heavily in Overlook Town, with the grand aim of making it into a thriving new settlement. Most of the town's real estate, the motel, the supermarkets, and most of the other commercial properties all belonged to one certain member of the Sutherland family.
And then there was the Starfall. Overlook Town will never get built now. Row upon row of unfinished houses, the freshly-poured foundations for luxury beach-side villas, even a movie theatre. All that luxury - the beautiful furniture, the expensive appliances - is just sitting there gathering dust. The whole town stands like a monument to the people who perished trying to construct it.
From a distance, the old site looked almost completely intact. There are dark forces lurking in that place. Otherwise, the place would've been stripped clean of valuables long ago &#91;1&#93;.
