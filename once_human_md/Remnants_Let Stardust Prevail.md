Those people from the west weren't lying... The Ceremony is feasible! Everyone who has gone through the test of Stardust will be accepted. We no longer fear Stardust! Or at lest... not as much. Add the blue fruits, meats and mushrooms to the cooking pot! The stew will make people feel a little dizzy and numb the limbs for a short time, but, at least we don't have to starve.
I've got this feeling... it's hard to describe. I feel like I'm about to split myself in two? With Stardust's blessing, I feel like I could divide myself many, many times. My mind is still there, but only vaguely, I feel like I can control all of these other versions of "me," like controlling a remote control car. It's hard to do it right, but I can practice...
