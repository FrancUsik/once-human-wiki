In the morning, Rosetta brought me a nice meal, the kind that comes in a proper lunch box! Seriously, I haven't had food this good in god knows how long,  and it's a far cry from the Tall Grass stews and those out-of-date canned goods. I wish I could start this afternoon, I've asked them several times to fill out an application, but no one has come to check me in yet, so I'll just have to stay put.
