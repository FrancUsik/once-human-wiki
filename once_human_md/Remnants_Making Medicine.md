I never thought I'd see the day. Glen Collins, my moron of a little brother, has stopped sleeping and barely ears. He's now spending all his waking hours pouring over a copy of Basic medical Chemistry.
Who knows if all that tinkering he's been doing in the basement will come to anything. What's the name of that drug my nephew used to take? Epto-something? I remember the last time I got some was six months ago, thanks to that kind Rosetta medic.
Now, the world has been destroyed, everyone is in danger, and Glen is still teaching himself how to make medicine for some terminally ill kid. What a waste of time.
Tomorrow, when we go out to search for supplies, we have to head out towards the Iron River. That was always the best place to find mayapple. Glen says he needs the root for his medicine. And I ain't taking responsibility when he screws up.
