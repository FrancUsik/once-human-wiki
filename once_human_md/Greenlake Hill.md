I still remember the neon lights shimmering in the midnight, and the bars resonating with music and lively chatter until dawn. It was like a hidden gem in this secluded mountain area."

Summary[]
Greenlake Hill is located in Chalk Peak at 844,-4429.

History[]
Following Starfall, survivors established a strong shelter in Greenlake Hill, taking advantage of the steep terrain and the expansive views. With a large population and abundant resources they maintained significant influence over the entire Chalk Peak region for several years following the Starfall.
However, they seemed to have developed a peculiar system of governance, resembling a matriarchy, with several women holding the power, and their decisions were often far from wise.
The shelter, unfortunately fell apart due to internal corruption and external threats. The surviving residents dispersed: some sought refuge in Tall Grass, some were captured by Rosetta, and some even transformed into Marauders. There are reports of some going west, becoming pioneers on the plains &#91;1&#93;.
