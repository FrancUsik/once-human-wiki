They Don't Understand[]

Everything I do, I do to protect this shelter. And I do it without hesitation or regret.
No one understands. They don't truly understand the Deviants or the Stardust pollution, and neither do they understand the significance of the decisions I have taken.
The effects of Stardust will not last forever. I've read the early studies. after a sufficient Omega reaction, the concentration of Stardust will decrease. any factors can affect this process, but I'm fairly certain that Stardust will reduce to a stable, tolerable level within 20-40 years... All we need to do is get through this, and keep the Silver Gate safe and sound, and humanity can finally enjoy a bit of respite...
But until then, we must conserve our resources as best we can. We must be prepared to do anything to ensure unity and protect our remaining numbers!
I'll try reasoning with them one more time. Simon Meyer, Sarah Buckley... But if I still can't make them understand...
