SUMMARY[]

After the mysterious silver door opened, the catastrophe came to this world. Human civilization has fallen in the invasion of Stardust pollution and abnormal forms. For 20 years, human beings have been struggling to survive in the mud. Until... You wake up. Some extraordinary people called Meta-Humans have appeared in this last world. Starting from the desolation, you have accumulated little by little the resources for survival, healed the land polluted by Stardust inch by inch, and recaptured one by one the sites of human civilization occupied by deformities. 




FACTIONS[]

Rosetta
 	 	 	 		 		 		 	 
Rosetta, named after the Rosetta Stone, is the only remaining tech giant post-disaster. They are obsessed with all kinds of radical research on heterospace life, in order to achieve the "uniform evolution" of mankind. What they did actually caused the collapse of the civilized world until now. Rosetta is still secretly continuing crazy attempts to influence and control the world. Rosetta has a strict internal hierarchy and masters a series of secret technologies that surpass human cognition. It is one of the main hostile forces that players need to fight against.

Mayfly
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
A rebel organization founded by a group of Beyonders and techies who escaped from Rosetta has been fighting against Rosetta for many years. In recent years, Mayfly has prevented many of Rosetta's conspiracies at the price of many casualties. This explains the small numbers of this faction. Although their lives are as fragile as mayflies in the face of the apocalypse, they still try their best to help other human survivalists, and save them from danger. Mayfly masters some of Rosetta's technology and Beyonder's power, using them to save the world. In the game, they are player's most reliable guide and partner.

The Union
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
The headquarters of Union is located in the Blackfell, which is in the vast Gobi desert, east of Nalcott. It was formerly an industrial town formed by workers from the oil industry. With the rich mineral and oil resources in the eastern wasteland of Nalcott, Union has gathered the power of most human survivalists in that area. They are accustomed to using transformed weapons like large-caliber shotguns, flamethrowers or incendiary bombs to protect this area.

Vultures
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
In the world where civilization has collapsed, not everyone is willing to insist their humanity. Some people feel that it is easier to survive by plundering others. This organization of bottomless predators call themselves Vultures. Vultures are undisciplined, raiding other survivalists' strongholds in groups, scavenging for all resources they want. Affected by pollution and drug abuse, Vultures are always in a state of madness and excitement. This makes them a large threat to players exploring the wilderness.


The Column
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Hidden in the snow-covered Arkam-Region in the north, the Column takes "rebuilding a new world order" as agenda. With the dangerous terrain and sufficient supplies, they maintain their living. Relying on the remains of crashed large transport plane, they established a semi-permanent military camp , which they named Icarus One.

Furugaku Gumi
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Furugaku Gumi is not a local organization of Nalcott, it originated in the far east and has a long history. During its long history, Furugaku Gumi accumulated astonishing wealth and secrets. Before the disaster, the express companies controlled by the Furugaku Gumi had already established in Nalcott. In addition to commercial attempts, it seemed that Furugaku Gumi has other unknown plans. In the game, they have sheltered a group of survivalists with the large amount of resources they have accumulated, and they have become a faction that should not be underestimated.



STORY[]

There have been countless organizations secretly researching the origin of species and civilizations in human history. The most successful organization in modern times is the Rosetta, whose predecessor was the Rosetta Institute established in 1967 by a French human historian Professor Rachael-Pierre-Luberni, who discovered the Rosetta Stone. Rosetta was dedicated to the study of pre-human civilization and pan-cosmology. Then it gradually became a multinational giant in the communication and information industry in public perception, and secretly extended all around the world. Professor Luberni devoted himself to the research on the evolution of ancient human civilizations in his early years. He believed that in human history, there was a civilization that clearly transcended the boundaries of human thinking and ability at that time. Exploring the secrets behind these civilizations would help mankind bring new changes to the modern civilization that had been completely stagnant. With the support of his friend and collaborator Samuel Lowe, Luberni obtained the Rosetta Stone in 1967 and deduced the material from it that did not belong to the Earth.
After extracting the substance, some of the researchers who did not take strict protection were infected and mutated. This substance was the Stardust that would bring catastrophe in the future. It turned out that they have appeared on the earth a long time ago and affected human beings. At the urging of Samuel, Luberni launched Rosetta's space physics project. They reorganized the Rosetta Society into the Rosetta Technology Group and increased funding to Nalcott University in order to conduct their research. In secret, they led the "Silver Key Project",  trying to open and strengthen the influence of heterospace on Stardust.
A few years later, the project "Silver Key" entered the final stage. The core laboratory of  Rosetta located under the Nalcott city activated the quantum tunneling apparatus, trying to open up the superposition space connecting the heterospace. With the dazzling flash, a spherical bubble gradually appeared above the target area, and a large number of unprecedented energy fluctuations dissipated from the quantum tunneling apparatus. It was initially indistinguishable to humans, so the sleeping Stardust was instantly activated and began to infect, multiply, and spread. Then the Nalcott City incident occurred, and a large number of creatures and humans were infected  and gradually turned into monsters. The Rosetta organization still had time to close the "Silver Gate" to end this catastrophe, but its management, especially Samuel Lowe, was unwilling to stop it. This disaster proved that they have been fighting in the right direction, and it was important for them to hold the key to the future firmly. Having achieved energy control, Rosetta actually mastered the way to control Stardust. They chose to cut ties with governments around the world, allowing the stardust to wreak havoc and even lead it to spread. This also led to the collapse of humanity in the ensuing 20 years.
The collapse of the world did not end Rosetta's ultimate goal, but instead made them achieve unprecedented results. They deeply integrated with stardust and heterospace energy, then gave birth to a new type of human being called Meta-Humans. The Meta-Humans had physical qualities far beyond that of normal humans and can control extraordinary powers. The nine most important Meta-Humans called “The Nine” which means the flesh of God.
However, Rosetta could not destroy the free will of human beings. Several members of The Nine and technicians escaped from Rosetta and formed the organization "Mayfly" to fight against Rosetta's conspiracy, Until now, they keep helping the human who are struggling to survive. They also try to save the Meta-Humans samples from Rosetta, inviting them to join the mayfly to grow their organization. Our player is one of the rescued Meta-Humans.
