Characteristics[]
Most otherworldly entities, whose life cycles are tied to the Rift Entity of Stardust, struggle to stabilize their existence in a material world where Stardust is scarce. The true form of the Ghoul remains unknown, though it is presumed to be a Rift Entity similar to the Mayhem. Its body is almost entirely concealed beneath large folds of fabric, with only four clawed appendages visible.

Behavior[]
The Ghoul moves on all fours, tirelessly pacing in search of prey. Once it identifies a target, it pursues relentlessly, lunging and gnawing with aggressive ferocity until its victim is subdued.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the shrouded head. 

Locations[]
Ghouls are low-ranking enemies commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Drops[]
Ghouls either drop various scrap materials or Acid.
