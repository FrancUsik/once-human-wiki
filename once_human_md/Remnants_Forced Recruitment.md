# Remnants/Forced Recruitment

Forced Recruitment[]
Hunter I-S6671
Gaia Military Base, East Chalk Peak
April 12, ▮▮32
The newly recruited low-level staff are still proving... difficult. I recommend we provide better quality meals in the coming days, and reward those who follow the rules. For those who cannot be tamed by conventional means, sedation can be considered, but try not to conduct "layoffs." The underground base is very short of manpower and clinical cases. The marketing department's tactics are becoming less and less effective, and the security forces are taking a huge risk every time they carry out a round of mandatory recruitment.
Oh, and also, make sure to reinforce the securement camp. Intelligence says that survivors (possibly family members of this group of recruits) are massing in the south, possibly preparing an unauthorized visitation. Stay vigilant. The period before transporting the new recruits back to the underground base is the most dangerous.
