Mart, hurry home, Lily is gone! When I went to work on the farm this morning, Lily followed me like normal. She thought the lawn mower was too loud and didn't want to sit on it, so I let her play in the field by the gate.
But when I came back, Lily wasn't there. I searched all over, and there was no sign of her! You know Lily wouldn't run away, what if someone snatched her? Oh God, I just hope Lily's safe.
