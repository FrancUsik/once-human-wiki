Characteristics[]
Staff Badges are clusters of interconnected balloons, each filled with joyful memories. These balloons symbolize achievements in Wish Land, with proofs of employment and promotions granted by an Ede. Retired Novice Employees, Senior Employees, or Customers unwilling to leave Wish Land ultimately merge with the cluster, becoming an integral part of it.

Behavior[]
Staff Badges drift through the air above Wish Land, their floating presence both mesmerizing and deceptive. When threatened, the Eyeballoon clusters separate, attacking individually to defend the whole. As the balloons take damage, they momentarily repel from the “body” of this Elite Deviant, exposing the entity’s vulnerable core.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, expose and strike the core hidden beneath the layers of balloons.
