Characteristics[]
Behavior[]
Strategy[]
Aim for the searchlight/head. However, be aware that Watchers can still attack even after the searchlight has been destroyed. It is best to kill Watchers from a distance as they can deplete the Player's Sanity when they get to close.

Locations[]
Watchers are low-ranking enemies, commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Field Guide/Dangerous Entities[]
Without Sleep or Rest
The Watchers provide illumination diligently, as they have since leaving the factory.
They are the most common humanoid types, with a battered searchlight in place of a head and cables coiled across their festering bodies.
The gaze of a Watcher can seize the strength and vitality of its victim until they collapse from exhaustion.
Why are you still at rest? Don't you know how to work hard?
