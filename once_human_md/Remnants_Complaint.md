Marty Hawkins, Fruit Farmer
Highland Residential Zone, South Iron River

This is the biggest market in the county, why can't it meet an ordinary farmer's needs? I just wanted a dozen bags of fertilizer.
I appreciate the door to door deliver, but my grapes all died after using our fertilizer! Even the unripened grapes have weird blue spots - what kind of poison is this? And don't tell me this wasn't because of the fertilizer  the day before I used it on the grapes, my wife was just remarking what a good crop we had this year.
