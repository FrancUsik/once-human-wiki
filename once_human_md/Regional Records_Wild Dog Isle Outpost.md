Regional Records: Wild Dog Isle Outpost[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
In the summer of '31, I made my fist visit to the Broken Delta since the Starfall. Seven years later, here I am again. This is now my fifth investigation into these isles. That notepad of mine is almost full of writings, all about spots I've set foot on over these years and dense with details. There is, however, one last place in this southern sea that I still haven't seen. It's what keeps my curiosity burning
Wild Dog Isle.
It wouldn't be a good idea to attempt to swim across that contaminated water. Just look at the tides lapping the shore, as thick and inky as they were at the time of the Starfall. Twenty years have elapsed, and Stardust residue still haunts this place. But, there must be something special about that island. Otherwise, why would those Rosetta expedition fleets take such a long detour along the western coast to this forgotten little corner of the southeast?
It's such a shame that I can only watch them through my telescope from so far away! A massive construction project is taking place on the island. Looks like they plan to build some kind of long-term settlement. But what for? Is there unpolluted land? Have they found some valuable new type of Deviated plant? Or do they simply want somewhere remote to build a new prison?
If only we also knew how to build those Stardust-proof ships. Maybe I could just "borrow" one from Rosetta?
