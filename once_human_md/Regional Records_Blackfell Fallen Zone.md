Blackfell Fallen Zone[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Blackfell Fallen Zone is a grim wound encompassing Blackfell's border, a constant reminder of the heavy price paid for the settlement's survival.
Before the Starfall, it formed the industrial outskirts of Blackfell. Rows of factories, warehouses, and workers' dormitories stretched along the oil pipelines, extending deep into the wilderness. Back then, the night sky was illuminated by the flames of refinery towers, and trucks roared day and night, transporting the "black gold." Now, all that remains are charred ruins and wandering Deviants. Thees monsters were once workers, soldiers, or simply poor souls trying to escape the Starfall, but have now become the rotting guardians of this land of death.
Standing on the edge of the Fallen Zone, I could smell the burned tar and putrid decay in the air. The ground at my feet was damp and sticky--whether with oul or something more dreadful, I could not tell. Blackfell's defense forces have set up a temporary perimeter around this zone, with warning signs that read: "DANGER: Pollution Zone. Trespassers will not be rescued."
