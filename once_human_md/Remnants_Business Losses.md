Why is Uncle David taking 40% of the profits, while we're over here paying a 10% tax for the privilege of setting foot on Rosetta's project site? And with our own trucks, no less! Old Uncle David was quick to bow down to Rosetta, I'll tell you that. Even his daughter--my Cousin Beth--isn't as bad as him. She's not the sharpest knife in the draw, but she knows what's up. She's got some backbone.
Back to the project, though, didn't you read the terms when you signed the contract? Couldn't you see what a bad deal this is for us? Let me tell you, you'll be paying back all the money lost in this project!
