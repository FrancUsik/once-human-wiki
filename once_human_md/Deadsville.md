Summary[]
James and Hannah Garland, a pioneering couple, discovered this haven untouched by Stardust while journeying from Meyer's Market. They decided to settle there, naming the sanctuary Deadsville. Together, they constructed fortifications, cultivated the land, and welcomed wandering survivors, establishing a modest post-apocalyptic waypoint.
Deadsville is considered a Union Stronghold.
