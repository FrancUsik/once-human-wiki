# NORTHERN PIKE B.P.

How to get[]
Fish can be obtained by fishing in the wilderness.
The Blueprints for Northern Pike and Frozen Northern Pike can be redeemed from the NPC Margerie, who can be found at docks.
It's advised to look for Margerie at the seashore to the east of the Blackheart's Bay Teleportation Tower in the Red Sands.
