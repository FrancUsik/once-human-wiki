Characteristics[]
The Lady In Mirror Elite Deviant (also known as “Mirror Girl”) retains much of her human form, still wearing her favorite blue dress adorned with floral prints. In place of her head is the mount for a large antique mirror, which she carries.

Behavior[]
The Lady In Mirror moves relatively slowly, concealing herself behind her mirror so that only the viewer’s own reflection is visible. Any projectiles fired at the mirror are reflected back as if they were beams of light. When she senses a threat, she retaliates by launching a volley of red projectiles. After taking critical damage, she retreats inside her mirror to recover her strength from the safety of her mirror realm.

Tips[]
Shooting the mirror she holds will only harm you. To maximize damage, quickly maneuver behind her and target her body, or use elemental or AoE attacks to circumvent the protection of her mirror.
