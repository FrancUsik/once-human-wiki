Oh, merciful and wise Matriarchs, praise be!
When sorrow and tragedy descended from the heavens, it was they who calmed the panicked masses. It was they who showed us the blessed land in the mountains where life could continue.
And so, we give thanks with song and the fruits of our labor. Great Matriarchs, we wish you everlasting health and happiness. May our shelter remain forever at peace under your glorious leadership.
