Gaia Military Base[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
This is a place of ugliness and darkness, and its shiny exterior can't hide its sordid nature.
This place is actually a Rosetta slave market, or as they call it, a "recruitment center." Whether through violence or deception, Rosetta brought in as many Survivors as they could control, and then, no one knows where they were taken to.
There have always been rumors that huge underground facilities were built underneath Nalcott Island. After Starfall, Rosetta established a strictly stratified society there, one similar to the slavery state of Ancient Rome. No one can verify these rumors' validity, but no one can deny them either, including Rosetta themselves. In any case, Rosetta has been scouring the wilderness for Survivors, and even if they aren't being used for such an unproductive purpose of "slavery," it's certainty not for anything good.
Someday, when the Union has built up enough power, we should destroy this place and rid it of all its wrongdoing.
