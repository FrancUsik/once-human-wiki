Mr. Moneybags' Order[]

What's the story with this Mr. York character? He bought the winery in FULL (yes, upfront! I even asked Ms. Sapir, and she said it was true!), and then he placed an order for several hundred cubic meters of the highest quality timber!!
Well, what else could I do? I praised Quinn York's impeccable taste and tried to get him to tell me what he wanted the timber for--he said it was to renovate the wine cellar. I don't understand rich people, that's for sure. Why bother renovating it? With all the money, he could just build a new one.
