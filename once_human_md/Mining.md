Resources[]
Rock[]
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			Rock

Sulfur can also be found commonly around the entire map, easily distinguishable by it's mustard yellow primary color, and gray under color.

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			Tin ore 		 	 
Tin ore can be first found in the Broken Delta, and then in all higher level areas, but does not spawn in the Dayton Wetlands. Distinguishable by chunks of silver nodules on a gray colored rock. 

Iron Ore[]
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			Iron ore 		 	 
Iron ore can be first found in the Iron River, and then in all higher level areas, but does not spawn in the Dayton Wetlands or Broken Delta. Distinguishable by it's rusted apperence on a gray colored rock.

Aluminum Ore[]
Aluminum ore can be first found in Chalk Peak, and then in all higher level areas, but does not spawn in the Dayton Wetlands, Broken Delta or Iron River. Distinguishable by plentiful chunks of silver nodules on a gray colored rock.

Tungsten Ore[]
Tungsten ore can first be found in the Red Sands region, and then in all higher level areas, but does not spawn in the Dayton Wetlands, Broken Delta, Iron River or Chalk Peak. Distinguishable by dark gray colored spikes pertruding from a gray colored rock. 

Silver Ore[]
Silver ore can be found rarely throughout the map. Distinguishable by large gray-ish nodules on a gray colored rock. The appearence is that of a dull tin ore.

Gold Ore[]
Gold ore can be first found in the Red Sands region, and then in all higher level areas, but does not spawn in the Dayton Wetlands, Broken Delta, Iron River or Chalk Peak. Distinguishable by it's almost purely golden design on a gray colored rock.

Pickaxes and Drills[]
At the start Meta-Humans will have no visible resource collecting tools, instead when mining nodes the player will pull out a rock and start hitting the selected node. This rock is used to gather a small amount of materials, often in order to craft the player's first pickaxe, the Crude Pickaxe. Below shows the different tools used for mining and their capabilities:
