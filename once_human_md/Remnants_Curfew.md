Rosetta can go rot in hell. Alan's farm has already gone through so much, and they still won't stop. I thought uprooting all the crops was going too far, but then they go scaring people out of their wits at night! Rosetta's goons are starting to feel like a sword above our necks here.
First we couldn't go near the construction zone of that big black tower, now we're not allowed to go out at night. Rosetta's just some company. Why do they have so many private soldiers? The other night I peeked our my window, and must have seen 50 or 60 people on duty, and I'm not even in the construction site! These goons are really trying to scare people off from going out at night.
