Mayor Dennis said that if Greywater wants to formally join the Union, we've got to start acting the part. And that includes maintaining proper communication links with the bigger, more established strongholds - starting with Meyer's Market, not too far too the south. But how come I'm the one that got stuck doing all the legwork, huh?
I the job of messenger really that bad? Well, it's nice not being on duty for twelve hours straight, like back in the stronghold. But it's dangerous out in the wilderness. You're constantly on edge, never knowing what kind of hideous monster is about to leap out from behind the next tree... And then there's the field rations, and the constant rain... When was the last time I ate a hot meal? Two days ago? Three?
They say the route along the east coast is "pretty safe." Ok, sure. I haven't seen too many Deviants or beasts so far, but what's up with my car suddenly running out of gas, eh?
I've made up my mind. I'm jut not suited to a career as a messenger. As soon as I get to Meyer's Market (assuming I DO get there in one piece, of course), I'm gonna resign, and apply to be a Meyer's Market resident instead. I've heard that Mayor Maxie isn't the friendliest. But hell, she can't be worse than Dennis Brock, right?
