The lunatics inside the Bunker actually shot at us... Joanne, the Matriarch, was killed. Some say she brought it upon herself, that she and the other deceased Matriarch invited this misfortune, trapping us all here. People seem to forget that it was a collective vote that condemned Inna and Aaron in the first place... So, talking about all this is pointless now. We need to break out, take advantage of the dark night and strong winds, and escape this desolate place called Greenlake. There should be other shelters to the east. Hopefully, they won't refuse to take us in, just as we did before.
