Summary[]
Dayton Hospital is a World Task in Dayton Wetlands. It is automatically collected when the Player is near Dayton Warehouse.

Objectives[]
Travel to Dayton Warehouse and speak with Paul.
Travel to Dayton Hospital and find the Emergency Meds (5790,-4501) on the second floor in a small supply room.
Complete Phase Shift Event.
Return to Paul for your reward.
Phase Shift Event[]
Upon interacting with the Emergency Meds you will phase shift. Exit the room and head down the hallway, then follow the hall to the left.
After a set of doors close in front of you, turn around and find a deviated wheelchair.
Follow the wheelchair through the door and continue running forward passing through the room multiple times until the Calendar on the wall reads "September 15th" (you start in January.) You won't actually be able to run back any further than Sept-15 as the door won't open again.
Once you reach Sept-15 interact with the phone on the counter. The door to the right (cardinal West) will open, proceed through it.
You should have the opportunity to secure Space Turner here. Doing so will exit you from the event space.
