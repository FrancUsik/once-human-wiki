Mom didn't sleep well last night. Even though she tried to smile and talk to me in the morning, I knew that the disease was crushing her. The other herbs are completely useless, so if mom asks again... I'll go collect some hemlock leaves.
I've kept her going for four years in this wilderness, for more years than she might have had otherwise. I don't regret the choice I made. Tall Grass? Bah, I'm never going back there again, not even if mom's gone. They are all inhumane bastards. I can go west. There are shelters on the other side of the mountains. I'm sure I'll find a use for my archery skills there.
