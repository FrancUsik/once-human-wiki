Regional Records: Harborside[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
It's been more than six months, and the gloom that has been hanging over the expedition team's heads has finally lifted. Having spent so long searching, finding a group of survivors has really lifted the group's spirits.
Were the survivors somehow able to discover that the sandbar in the river was still unpolluted by Stardust? It all seems so unlikely, even thinking about it now. The survivors were just a bunch of regular people. Healthy, but not exceptionally skilled. We had a lot in common. We established an especially good relationship with their leader - Simon Meyer. Simon is a really charismatic guy. He gave us a lot of useful information about the surrounding area, and even volunteered to serve as our guide. He showed us the way to some important yet remote sites, like Harborside.
Simon's theory about what happened to this town seems very reasonable to me. Simon believes that Harborside was ransacked by a Rift Entity early on. Even if anyone managed to escape this attack, they must've perished sometime during the subsequent decade of hardship. The way things currently stand there is no possibility of settling here. The land and air are both still thick with Stardust - even the sea off the dock is covered in a thick blue-black residue.
But there was still value in coming here. With the information we've gathered, we'll be able to chart a more accurate map of Nalcott Island. Which places are safe, which places are worth investigating in more depth, and so on.
My hope is that one day, this information will motivate us... the Union... all of humanity... to take back this world for ourselves.
