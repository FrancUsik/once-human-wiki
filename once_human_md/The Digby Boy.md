The The Digby Boy is a territory deviation. When placed inside of an Isolated Securement Unit in the player's territory, it will go out and mine specific ores for the player, or use a Mining Operation Platform.

Obtaining[]
The Digby Boy can be obtained through the completion of Deviation Expert, one of the initial tasks given by Lowe in Deadsville.
The Digby Boy is a random chance award from mining Silver Ore. It has been observed that the chances to drop him significantly lower after the first two drops, making the increased odds go on a 4 hour cooldown. It is also guaranteed to drop from the first Tin Ore that the player mines. After that, The Digby Boy can only drop from Silver.

Deviation Skill[]
Mine Ore: Goes out mining when activated. The higher the Deviant Energy level, the more efficient the mining is. Will use a Mining Operation Platform first if available.
The The Digby Boy will use the mining operation platform if it is available, making the platform an automated process. The player will still have to collect the resources from the platform instead of the The Digby Boy's isolated securement unit.

Story[]
"Deviation O-025 consists of a series of small figurines made from metal ingots in a simplistic humanoid shape. Each figurine has a large cubic head with three oval-shaped etchings in a 2-1 pattern to represent a rudimentary face. A series of rectangular prisms form the torso and limos.
The Deviation's O-025 main trait is its ability to reshape any metals of similar composition and purity to itself. The Deviation can craft a range of common tools including pickaxes, hammers, and saws, mechanical parts for machines, and repair itself, if damaged. The Deviation must make physical contact with the metal in order to reshape it. It performs this action rather like a human potter molding clay.
Deviation O-025 can also absorb metals to purify them. Impurities are expelled as a kind of slag-like waste product. This causes the Deviation to grow in size. If the Deviation grows too large, it can even become immobilized due to its own weight.
Currently, 26 figurines are in securement. Research suggests that, although the figurines are capable of performing complex actions, they are not truly intelligent, and are simply automatons executing a pre programmed script.
In the wild, the Deviation will continuously search for metal to construct a large complex mechanical structure (logged as O-025-A) made of springs, linkages, and hydraulics. If multiple Deviation O-025 figurines encounter each other, they will cooperate, and work together on a single mechanical structure. If the Deviation is deprived of metal for an extended period, it will become restless and increasingly aggressive.
Once a O-025-A mechanical structure reaches ■■■■, it will switch on. The Deviation will continue to gather metals and feed them into the machine, which the machine will use as fuel to produce a series of duplicate figurines (logged as O-025-B). Notably, as an O-025-A machine produces more 0-025-B duplicate figurines, the original figurine appears to grow in intelligence and autonomy.
Securement Procedures:Do:Each O-025 figurine should be secured individually in a standard Level II securement chamber lined with any high-strength organic material.Provide each O-025 figurine with a steady supply of metals at least twice a week, and dismantle any O-025-A machine it constructs. (Note: this can be done within the securement chamber in full view of the Deviation, and will not provoke hostility). The scrap from a dismantled O-025-A machine should be disposed of in a Level IV incinerator.Do Not:Allow O-025-B duplicate figurines to be created."
