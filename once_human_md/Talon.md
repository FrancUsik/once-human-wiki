The guy who goes by "Talon," what is his real name again? I'm sure I knew it at one point.
He was my comrade in arms We fought side by side. I trusted him with my life, and I thin he would say the same. He's saved me, and I've saved him.
He was brave, too. Until that final battle, when he suddenly lost his nerve. Not that anyone can blame him. He's been through more than most of us go through in a lifetime. He proved his bravery many times - before it finally broke him.
