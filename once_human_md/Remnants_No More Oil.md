# Remnants/No More Oil

No More Oil[]
Patton Browning, Oil Worker
Depleted Oil Well
November 13, ▮▮18
They're dead. I mean the oil wells here, not your bright futures, you Rosetta elites. How the hell did you drain all the oil here in only a couple of years?! I'm an oil well worker, not a miracle worker, don't expect me to save this mess.
My advice is not to waste your time on spent oil wells, you should have found the next place to pump this stuff out of the earth a long time ago. You can tell your superiors that the oil wells here are dry. But maybe that guy Otto might be able to help you out. He's always at home, burying himself in his research. He might know something.
