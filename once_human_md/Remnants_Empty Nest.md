This used to be a prime spot for bird watching. Now it's completely different. Starfall didn't just affect mankind. Just look at all the empty bird nests nearby - they were unable to withstand the Stardust.
The birds could could watch as the blue Stardust (or maybe it wasn't blue; birds identify colors better  than people) approached. Try as they might, they couldn't escape their fate. The corrupted birds have become hideous beasts, and their once gentle nature have been twisted to be full of aggression. Such is the fate of the birds corrupted by Starfall; they never stood a chance.
Innumerable nests are abandoned here. People also have abandoned homes, but we've got Greywater to the northwest - some ragtag place that we can call home. But what about the birds?
