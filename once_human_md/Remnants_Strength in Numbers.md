Anne, you must have noticed that Jesse has been acting a little... out of control lately. He's our brother, and he's been number one in the family since the Old Man got sick. I don't think it's a good idea to confront him alone, but what if we unite? I don't mean pick a fight. Just give him some advice, is all. You and I both know, the family is in a pretty deep hole right now...
We were blinded by greed. But now I can see it. Rosetta has forced us into a corner, and there ain't no turning back. Rumors have been spreading throughout Harborside. Weird things have been happening, too. Ever since those Monoliths were out into operation... Rosetta says they are just power generator, but I don't buy it! I've already told me people to make some... emergency preparations. I'm afraid things might get even worse. An environmental catastrophe, some weird geological disaster... who knows? Anyway, Annie, you and Eli need to hurry up and make your decision, so we can make our next move.
