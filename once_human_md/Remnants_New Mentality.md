Now we've cleared that den of mutated wolves, the camp is officially up and running. Things got a little hairy, but we managed to grab a good stash of food and ammo from Silvershore Resort. Nonetheless, we're playing it safe, and keeping our daily rations low. After all, we brought six people with us. It's always good to have a few extra pairs of hands, but not if we can't feed them all.
Miles came up with the idea of expanding our list of eligible prey. He looked a bit nervous about the idea, but I fully support it. After all, why limit ourselves to four-legged beasts and two-legged birds? We already got our hands dirty as we were retreating from Silvershore Resort. Why not go all-in and fully embrace the Marauder mentality?
