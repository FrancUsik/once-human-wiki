We're in the middle of a heat wave right now, but even so, we haven't had many tourists. Chalk Peak just hasn't been the same since Rosetta started pumping in cash. First it was the mines and the factories, and now, you can see it in the eyes of the residents too. The people of this town are honest folks, and they like to have a good time. But now, the streets are empty. Everyone just stars at home, wondering if they'll have a job by the end of the week. At this rate, I'll be bankrupt before long, too. Little Inna's still pretty cheerful though, because no, there's no one around to stop her playing n the boats. She and the Tout boy spend entire days climbing around on those boats, not sparing a thought for her aunt's financial troubles...
