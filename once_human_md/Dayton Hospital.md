Summary[]
Dayton Hospital is located in the Dayton Wetlands at 5600,-4650.

History[]
The Dayton Hospital, built by Rosetta to support the Monolith construction project, is located right nice to the Monolith itself. No one could set foot in there without a Rosetta name badge. The doctors and nurses, the sick and wounded patients, and even the security guards were all Rosetta personnel. Even the other buffer zone was out of bounds to locals &#91;1&#93;.
No one from Rosetta is still active around here. The place has become pretty heavily polluted by Stardust, and thanks to the Monolith, it's likely to stay that way &#91;1&#93;.
