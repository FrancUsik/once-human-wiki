No one could possibly doubt Klein's character, or his capabilities. After seeing his performance during yesterday's test, Ian has nothing but praise for the guy, and I agree.
But still, I don't think he's got the right mindset to become a truly outstanding Hunt leader. We all saw how Klein was able to rescue the Pearson girl. Quick thinking, to be sure, but that was never part of the plan. The weak and the feeble have no place out in the wasteland. We live in a harsh world, and Klein's actions were a violation against nature.
I don't think he should be promoted any time soon.
