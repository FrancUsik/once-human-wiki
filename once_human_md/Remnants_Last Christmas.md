# Remnants/Last Christmas

Last Christmas[]
Bailey Hodges, Marauder
Clifton, North Iron River
December 23, ▮▮25
Everyone who said Brewster's riches were hidden here can go screw themselves! There's not even a turd left in Clifton, just a few wandering Deviations. Everyone else must be jealous I could so quickly understand the mysteries of the True God, so they tricked me into wasting my time here.
It's a pity that they can't understand the True God. All those with jealousy, hypocrisy, and hatred in their hearts should be washed away with blood, same for those with the weaknesses of pity and sympathy...
I hope they enjoy this Christmas, because when I get back to camp, they'll discover it's their last.
