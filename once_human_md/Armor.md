# Armor

There are 6 sections of the player that is covered when wearing armor: head, face, torso, legs, hands, and feet. These sections can be covered using matching armor sets, or by mixing and matching armor pieces from differing sets. Armor increases the player's maximum HP, DMG Reduction, and other benefits, based on the armor worn.

Basics[]
Armor can only be crafted at gear workbenches; tier I - II armor can be crafted at any primary, intermediate, or advanced gear workbench. Tier III - IV armor can only be crafted at either an intermediate, or advanced gear workbench. Tier V armor can only be crafted at an advanced gear workbench.
Armor crafting requires blueprints, which can be obtained through exploring Strongholds, opening Mystical Crates, using the Wish Machine which requires Starchrom. Sometimes there will be events on, such as the "Gather Friends" event, in which players can share up to 5 of their known blueprints with other players.

Tier Level[]
Armor tier level determines which materials are used to craft them and their overall stats and level requirement, ranking from tier I - tier V (1-5). Players unlock the ability to wear higher tier armor every time they level up 10 times:

Tier I: lvl 1
Tier II: lvl 10
Tier III: lvl 20
Tier IV: lvl 30
Tier V: lvl 40
Players are able to obtain armor tiered higher than what they can equip, but they cannot wear them until they reach the level requirement. Note: this goes for armor transferred from the Spacetime Backpack.

Calibration[]

Calibrating armor can improve various aspects of the armor's performance. You can perform calibrations at any gear workbench. Higher tier armor allows for more calibration slots:

Tier I: 2 slots
Tier II: 2 slots
Tier III: 4 slots
Tier IV: 4 slots
Tier V: 6 slots
Calibration materials are dependent on which materials the player needed to craft the armor piece. For example, a tier I Rustic Hat requires Shabby Fabric to craft it, and therefore also uses shabby fabric to calibrate it. 

Repairing Armor[]

The durability of an armor piece will decrease as you take damage. Once the armor piece's durability has reached 0 it will break and become unusable. Players can repair armor pieces at a gear workbench, no matter how much duration is left (unless the armor piece is at full duration); the materials used depend on the tier of the armor piece being repaired.

Armor Set Perks[]

Wearing multiple pieces of armor from the same "armor set" will grant additional effects that differ between sets. Effects can include increases in HP, to increases in Crit Rate, to unique attributes for specific sets, such as the Bastille set buff that boosts damage while crouching and standing still (Pictured).
