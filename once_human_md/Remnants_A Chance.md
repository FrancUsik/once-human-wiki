# Remnants/A Chance

A Chance[]
Martha Augustus, Matriarch
Greenlake Hill, West Chalk Peak
November 5, ▮▮32
You heard it right, Mr. Morton. For the crime of hoarding food, the Council of the Matriarchs has decided on your punishment: permanent banishment from Greenlake Hill!
However, considering your years of diligent service to all the residents of Greenlake Hill, cultivating the land and bring us plentiful harvests, and also considering your wife Daisy's plea... we have decided to give you a second chance.
You may remain in Greenlake Hill... but you will be confined to your home, with meals delivered to you daily. Yes, it will include the "risky food" you've always avoided. We don't wish to harm you, but we need a volunteer to test whether the food we've "processed" is truly safe.
