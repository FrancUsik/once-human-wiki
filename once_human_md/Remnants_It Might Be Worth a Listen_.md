Reeve Ricci is still alive. I can't believe it.
I'm starting to think he really might have some kind of superhuman powers. I remember when he had that falling out with Guard Captain Erica, and was threatened with expulsion into the wilderness, where he'd have to fend for himself, and he literally just waked out the door, empty-handed and smiling. He turned the corner at the end of the road without looking back. We were all standing there dumbfounded, obviously.
Two months passed and then he came back, and without a scratch on him! Kelly Hill checked him over as thoroughly as she could, but there wasn't even a trace of Stardust infection on him either.
We all used to just think of him as a maverick, maybe kind of a werido. But now... Stephan is having a party at his house tonight, and Reeve Ricci is gonna be there. He has some really unique life experiences, and he really knows how to survive in the wilderness and whatnot.
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to go and have a listen?
