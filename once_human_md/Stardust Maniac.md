Characteristics[]
Useless Afterbirth[]
The Maniac is the petri dish in which the "Sky Dome Mother" cultivates her offspring. As the "seed," of the "life" of the Memetic infection grows deeper, the Maniac loses weight rapidly due to abnormal absorption of biomass.
Additionally, the Maniac's skull deforms, expands, and dissolves as the brain and nervous system break down into protocell colloids and start to proliferate uncontrollably to form abnormal a cnidaria-like entity called "Cogitarid."
The "Cogitarid" eventually becomes independent from the host survival, and the host dies.

Behavior[]
Due to severe physical mutations, Stardust Maniacs can only attack in rudimentary ways, driven by unrelenting compulsion. Even if the Maniac’s head is destroyed, its body may remain animated and dangerous until completely neutralized.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, target the Stardust Maniac’s head.

Locations[]
Stardust Maniacs are low-ranking enemies commonly found throughout Nalcott.
Drops[]
Stardust Maniacs may drop various scrap materials or Acid.
