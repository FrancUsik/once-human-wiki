The boss is real excited today; we brought in nearly 20 ponds of fresh meat, without bones even, but he still looks at me like he's starving. The boss will stare at something for ages, usually the buildings in the southern highlands, and then suddenly laugh out loud, like some wild animal.
I get the feeling the boss has won over the holy angel Jill, he always manages to think of ways to carry out the holy angel's will, but I can't even understand a word of the holy angel's thoughts...
