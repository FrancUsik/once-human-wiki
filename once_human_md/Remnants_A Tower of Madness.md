# Remnants/A Tower of Madness

A Tower of Madness[]

I'm not anti-intellectual, and I've never believed the rumors that high-voltage electricity pylons cause cancer. But it IS true that the rates of all kinds of mental disorders have been skyrocketing in this area of the last six months.
It all started after the Black Tower began its "test run." Rosetta insists that tower is just a cutting-edge energy generation facility, cleaner than thermal power, safer than nuclear power, and less limited than hydroelectric power. The only downside is that it tends to drive the people who live nearby crazy!? George Hathaway has always been sharp, a good worker. And then, he takes one trip up to Black Tower for supplies, and bam! Now he doesn't know if he's supposed to pee in the toilet or my cup of tea.
This town deserves an explanation. And it won't come from the Rosetta press office, obviously. Their "official statements" are nothing but a pack of lies. But, there is a place... the Dayton Hospital, Rosetta's internal medical facility... I might be able to find some answers there...
