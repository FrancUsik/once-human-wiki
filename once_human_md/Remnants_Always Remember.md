That kid is gone... His friends say he climbed into the restricted area fetch a couple of cans that had rolled behind the fence. No one had seen him since. Not until this morning, that is. Someone from Rosetta's public relations department brought Kerry's basket back, saying it was the only bit left of him... They claim that he accidentally touched the high-energy equipment and got frazzled into nothingness.
I don't buy it. No one does. It was Rosetta who did Kerry in. They draw up their so-called "restricted area" around that Black Tower, stick up their bulletin boards, and refuse to budge even one damn inch. Mrs/ Blunt cried her heart out, the poor woman. She took Rosetta's humanitarian" compensation in the end, though. What else could she do?
