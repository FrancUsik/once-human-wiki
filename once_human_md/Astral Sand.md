Obtaining[]
Astral Sand can be obtained in several ways:

Selling Items[]

Applicable items gathered throughout the player's time in a scenario will be sent to their Spacetime Backpack when the scenario ends, or if they use a scenario exit card. These gathered items and materials will remain in the player's spacetime backpack until either moved into storage on the player's Eternaland, brought into another scenario via Eternaland Transfer, or sold for Astral Sand.
Players can sell almost anything they gather via the selling tab in Eternaland by pressing 'F8' and selecting 'Sell', seen in the picture to the right, in the 'Island Shop' section. There are 2 places that players can sell from, the first is the spacetime backpack, which can be easily identified from the cradle icon. The second place is from Eternaland storage, which is identified from the island icon; Eternaland storage takes every item from within any storage facilities placed down within the island.

Completing Orders[]

Astral Sand, and Astrealite, can be obtained from completing weekly orders. Weekly orders can be found by pressing 'F8' and selecting the 'Order' section at the top of the screen.
There are a total of 8 orders per week, rewarding players for doing various activities such as partaking in agriculture: growing tomatoes, pumpkins, onions, etc. and fishing. Player's will get more Astral Sand per order depending on the difficulty. Completing fishing orders will give the player 16,200 Astral Sand and 450 Astrealite, whereas completing agriculture orders will net the player 3,600 Astral Sand and 120 Astrealite.
Several times a week, players can earn extra rewards from orders, determined by the order's base rewards. The player gets 6/8 bonus rewards, which reset every week.

Energy Link Conversion[]
At the end of a scenario, as many Energy Links the player has accumulated will be converted automatically into Astral Sand at a 1:1 ratio.
