The past few years haven't been easy for any of us. The economy's in a bad way, industries are disappearing... But THIS is where I draw the line! Ms. Beverly's own birthday, and no cake?! I don't care if she insists on being frugal and keeping things simple - this is an important occasion. It's a question of prestige for the whole of Holt Town, if you ask me. No, this is what we'll do. We'll use the largest cake molds, and the absolute best frosting and whipped cream we can get our hands on. Don't worry about being wasteful, or Ms. Beverly getting mad. I'll take full responsibility.
