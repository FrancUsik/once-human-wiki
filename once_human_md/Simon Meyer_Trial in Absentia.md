This court, presided over by the Honorable Owen Hicks, will now issue its judgement in the case against defendants Simon Meyer, Sarah Buckley, and others. They stand accused of conspiracy to commit rebellion and attempted murder of an officer of the court. On the date of March 24, 2026, Criminal Judgment No. 014 was rendered. The verdict is as follows:
The principal defendant Simon Meyer is found guilty on both counts. The defendant resisted arrest and has absconded from the jurisdiction, and is therefore sentenced to death in absentia, to be executed immediately upon arrest. Defendants Sarah Buckley, Benjamin Miller, Dave Joyce, and Wahid Hussein, all accomplices, are also found guilty on both counts. They are also sentenced to death in absentia, to be executed immediately upon arrest.
