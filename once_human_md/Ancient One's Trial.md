The Ancient One&#39;s Trial is a Public Crisis Event where the player must climb up a rocky mountain to its peak in Areas#Chalk Peak, and then use Updraft Cannons to jump onto a giant plane. On this plane, the player will have to interact with a red glowing sphere to begin the event. After a quick tutorial, showing the player the core concept of the event, it begins soaring through the sky. The player's goal is to shoot the balloons that appear to increase their score for better rewards.

Concept[]
Players must pop the balloons that appear whilst in the sky, within a time limit. Each balloon color is worth a different amount of points. However, black balloons are not worth any points, but will help the player to efficiently pop more balloons with the area of effect explosion it creates once popped.

Tips[]
Due to the low HP of the balloons it is recommended that players use Copper Ammo to conserve higher tier ammunition.
Weapons with large magazines or fast reload speeds are recommended, allowing the player to hit as many balloons as possible before passing them.
Using weapons with the Bounce effect, or having an Unstable Bomber build can help pop multiple balloons simultaneously.

Upon completion the player will receive one of the following rewards depending on their final score:
