Should we drive out of here?
This idea has been circling in my head for two days. This is no place to stay for a long time. I can already imagine the fight between us three guys after the supplies run out. That kind of fight won't have any real winners.
Jeffrey's got a strong will to survive, that makes him especially scary at a time like this. He's an honest man, though. Laurence, meanwhile, is creeping me out. He keeps staring at me silently, like a snake looking at its prey. I hope that's just my imagine action. Jeffrey is the easiest one to trick, maybe I shall start with him. 
I'll need to talk it over with them first. I think driving out is still feasible. After all, there's no shortage of fuel or drivers.
