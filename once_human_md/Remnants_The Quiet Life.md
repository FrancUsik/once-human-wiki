God, not another one of Toby's mobilization meetings. After three months here, I can recite his stupid pop talk from memory!
Blah blah blah, Greywater industrial zone, blah blah blah for the cause of reconstruction. I don't have any grand desire to rebuild civilization. There! I said it! As long as I've got enough to eat and drink, and a bed to sleep in where I can be sure a Deviant won't sneak in at 3 AM and eat my liver, that's enough for me.
