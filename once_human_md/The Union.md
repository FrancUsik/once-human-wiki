# The Union

The Union's headquarter is located in the Blackfell, which is in the vast Gobi desert, east of Nalcott. It was formerly an industrial town formed by workers from the oil industry. With the rich mineral and oil resources in the eastern wasteland of Nalcott, Union has gathered the power of most human survivalists in that area. They are accustomed to using transformed weapons like large-caliber shotguns, flamethrowers or incendiary bombs to protect this area.
