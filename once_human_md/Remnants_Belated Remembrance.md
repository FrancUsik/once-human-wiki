Belated Remembrance[]
Ted Holt, Union Leader
Holt Town, East Chalk Peak
September 15, ▮▮34
I'm sorry, Mom. I've been occupied with work in the North and couldn't come to visit you until now.
Did you know? I started a new business - more precisely, a "Citizens Mutual Support Union" or the Union as it is known. It's growing fast, with many "business partners" joining me. Now, we have a dominant market share on the East Coast - that's the gist of it.
Don't worry, the refinery is still under operation, and I haven't abandoned the workers who went through tough times with e. But Samantha, Edward, and Felix are gone. They're buried in the North, with Dad and those who gave their life for this land. I'll visit you again, Mom, Next time, when Doug and little Pauline are a but older, I'll bring them here.
