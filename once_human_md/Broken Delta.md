Description[]
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 Broken Delta is the second region introduced in Once Human and is accessible as the game's second major explorable area. This region is comprised of fishing villages, industrial complexes, and dense forested terrain, providing varied terrain and exploration opportunities.
Broken Delta introduces two new hostile factions: Rosetta, a mysterious group tied to Starfall, and the Vultures, a ruthless band of marauders. Enemies and settlements within Broken Delta&#160;range from level 11-20.
The main Union Settlement in this region is Meyer's Market.
