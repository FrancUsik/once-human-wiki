Characteristics[]
The Claw Machine is a twisted abomination, as if someone crushed, mangled, and fused an entire Chagas Weevil into an innocent claw machine to create this grotesque hybrid. Instead of its fleshy arm, the creature has a large mechanical claw, and a giant stuffed bear dangles from its underbelly, where the bottom half of the crane game is attached.

Behavior[]
For the most part, this Elite Deviant behaves like a typical Chagas Weevil, with one key difference: its vile projectiles. When provoked, the Claw Machine grabs the large stuffed bear from its underbelly and hurls it at its attackers. The bear aggressively pursues its targets, eventually exploding in a massive puddle of viscous fluid that corrodes the sanity of those within the blast radius.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, target the small stuffed bear on top of its arm (where the Chagas Weevil’s eye would normally be), the mangled underbelly, and the giant stuffed bear while it’s still attached to the Claw Machine.
