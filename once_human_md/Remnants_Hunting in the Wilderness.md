# Remnants/Hunting in the Wilderness

Hunting in the Wilderness[]

According to Tall Grass "rules," I have to bring in enough rations for 5 people before Mark and Vivian are allowed in. Can you believe it?! My father died so that others could live, and THIS is how they treat the children of their heroes?! It's getting harder and harder to hunt around Tall Grass, as well. That's why I've had to start making longer journeys, trying my luck further out... Gotta remember to stay clear of Greenlake Hill though. Real "shoot first and ask questions later" types over that way.
