# Remnants/Sense of Danger

Sense of Danger[]

That black tower of Rosetta's... it just feels too close to us here in Alkirk. God forbid anything happens with it. At night, you can always see this strange blue mist there, and there are fewer and fewer people form Rosetta. It's all too strange. And why is there such an anxious atmosphere, a feeling of danger, like a war is about to break out? There are fewer and fewer people in town nowadays.
It doesn't feel like a successful project is about to be completed! When the church in the town was finished, I remember the waves of guards and spectators, and the voice of the choir floated out from the church. Thinking of that sound still makes me feel peaceful, even today.
