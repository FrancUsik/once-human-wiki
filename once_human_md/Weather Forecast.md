Characteristics[]
The Weather Forecast Elite Deviant is an unsettling fusion of four Rainfall Reaper Deviants. Its head is no longer a single umbrella but instead a vintage CRT TV, connected by twisted, tangled wires trailing from behind. The viscous black fluid that once supported its clothing has long dried, leaving brittle, threadbare ropes in its place.

Behavior[]
Despite their decayed forms, Weather Forecasts are significantly stronger than Rainfall Reapers. They can manipulate the weather and teleport unpredictably. Their attacks leverage air, rainwater, and earth as destructive mediums, striking with the force of natural disasters—making them a deadly threat to unprepared victims. Fortunately, just before each assault, Weather Forecasts enter a brief state of confusion and emit a sharp alarm, serving as a warning of imminent disaster.

Strategy[]
Focus your attacks on the powered television head to maximize damage.
