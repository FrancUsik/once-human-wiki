Could there be some kind of symbiotic relationship between the Deviation and the survivors? The research team has long debated this, and as the reintroduction to the surface continues, we are finding more and more examples. The supermarket, for example, is known to have existed before Starfall, but Stardust transformed it into a Deviation (which we've named Star-M843) filled with dislocated space. Survivors have inhabited it for years.
Traces found indicate that those people skillfully used the rift space inside Star-M843 to hide from all kinds of hazards (beasts and Deviants alike). They also looked for water and food in the rift space for a long time and even set up semi-permanent shelters inside (sadly, these people are nowhere to be found). We have requested that Star-M843 be secured and a special team will arrive shortly.
