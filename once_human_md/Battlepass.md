Battle Passes[]
The Battle Pass contains 60 levels for the player to unlock, giving them various rewards. Battle Pass XP can be gained by doing any in-game tasks that give the player regular XP, such as exploration, tasks, combat, Eternaland, and crafting. There is also an "Obtain Exp" tab where players can see what current tasks will yield double XP upon completion. Additionally, there is a "Shop" tab, where players that purchase the Advanced or Luxurious editions of the Battle Pass can spend their Silver Keys on territory decorations, character cosmetics, and weapon cosmetics.

Luxurious Battle Pass[]
The luxurious Battle Pass costs $23.99, and contains all the above-mentioned items, with extras that are immediately given to the player. These items always match the theme of the Battle Pass, and often include a Cradle skin and building items. If you purchase the Advanced Battle Pass edition, you can upgrade to the Luxurious Edition for $13.99.

Ranking Up[]
Battle Pass XP can be gained in various different ways, such as exploration, tasks, combat, Eternaland, and crafting. There is also an "Obtain Exp" tab where players can see what current tasks will yield double Battle Pass XP upon completion. Battle Pass XP gained is the equivalent of regular XP gained x 0.10, meaning the player will receive 10% of the regular XP they obtain through doing different tasks in-game.

Claiming Rewards per Character[]
When claiming rewards, the character that is currently being played will be the one to receive the claimed rewards, and they cannot be claimed again on an alternative account.
