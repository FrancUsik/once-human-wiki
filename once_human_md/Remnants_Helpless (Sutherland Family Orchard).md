Anne Sutherland, Vineyard Owner
Sutherland Vineyard, South Dayton Wetlands

In the end, I couldn't stop him. I know that now. That man has pounced on each of our individual weaknesses.
Joan wanted a shipping company at her disposal, Donald wanted to consolidate his position at the chemical plant, Nelson wanted to improve his standing within the family, and Keefer... the beloved Keefer... it's widely known that he wanted money. And money is the one thing Rosetta has never been short of.
In the end, it was me that Eli wanted, and I, in turn, wanted him
The man said he could get us what we wanted, he said it would be easy. And hell, I know he was telling the truth. He never exaggerated or attempted to hide the truth.
So even though we had no idea what a so-called "Monolith" actually is (he swore it was some kind of energy device? Screw him!), we have in to our desires, our greed. We agreed to help Rosetta... infiltrate our land. Ultimately, we brought about our own destruction.
The Old Man doesn't have many years left to live. Sorry, uncle. I can only hope you never have to find out what your unworthy descendants have done.
