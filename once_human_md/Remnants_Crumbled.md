A school? Judging by the appearance of the classroom, it hadn't been fully abandoned after the Starfall. Someone had been diligently maintaining it, keeping things clean and tidy. The scene reminded me of Sunbury Middle School and Ms. Kia Armas.
Resuming education in Greenlake Hill feels like a lost cause. Goodwill didn't offer any assistance whatsoever. The children who were sent to us seem to only blindly worship and obey their Matriarchs, lacking any ability to act independently. Anyone who genuinely cared about these kids and their future would feel a sense of despair.
