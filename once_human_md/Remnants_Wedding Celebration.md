# Remnants/Wedding Celebration

Wedding Celebration[]
Joanne Sosi, Matriarch
Greenlake Hill, West Chalk Peak
March 2, ▮▮26
Mrs. Walton will get remarried next week. Both Jimmy Reed and Jonathan Woolleys proposed to her. Tonight, a vote will be held int he Matriarch Council to decide which man will become her new husband.
Speaking of which, the Cronin girl is also coming of age. She's still as mischievous as ever. Maybe marriage will help tame her spirits. There are several good candidates, and I think Ansel Burn may be the perfect match for her. He's a little older, but he's a man who commands respect. No one would dare misbehave in his presence.
