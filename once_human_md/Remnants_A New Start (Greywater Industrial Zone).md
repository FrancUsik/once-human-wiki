# Remnants/A New Start (Greywater Industrial Zone)

A New Start[]
Horace Berg, Union Courier
Greywater Industrial Zone, Northwest Iron River
March 28, ▮▮37
I really owe Rod Cohen. I still remember his name, but I don't know anything else. Ever since I was rescued from the southern highlands by the people of Greywater, I've had memory issues. God knows what happened to me down there. The people at the Greywater camp found a friend of mine, maybe my only friend, and that was Rod.
I don't like to think about wha happened, it gives me a splitting headache Memory problems are no big deal, at least not in this day and age. It's better not remember some things. Now that I'm back on my feet and can be sent to the industrial area, a new start sounds great. Who knows what would have happened if Mr. Cohen hadn't told them that old Horace Berg here was stripped naked and tied to a tree for two whole days by those Vultures...
