S0112 Squad has arrived at the predetermined location, and under the premise of ensuring that all necessary protective measures have been taken, Dr. Brooks I F0251 and researcher Cox II F2904 led the Squad into Deviation-0427.
The deviation is a red pill with a diameter of about 5mm, which frequently appears out of then air in food that is about to be eaten (food held by tools such as spoons and forks), and is often swallowed by mistake. According to the statement of a subject who had taken the red pill y mistake and is now sober, he felt relaxed after taking it, then could not perceive the existence of his body (similar to the effect of an anesthesia), but he was conscious and active in his thinking, recalling the detail of past events, and often feeling negative emotions such as regret, pain, and guilt.
Dr. Brooks I F0251 issued an order that the S011 Squad should closely monitor the local Stardust concentration and focus on numerical changes to secure the Deviation. Securement was completed on the 9th.
