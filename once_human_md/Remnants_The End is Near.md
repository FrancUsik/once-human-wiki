# Remnants/The End is Near

The End is Near[]
Stan Roy, Doctor
Greenlake Hill, West Chalk Peak

Almost no healthy babies were born this year. Inna's curse seems to be coming true, which means Greenlake is in serious trouble. But what's causing all this? Is it the food? The water? There were no blue spots on the wheat or the fruit. So how come this is still happening?
I think it's finally time to get some outside help. I've heard that there is a doctor in Tall Grass who was sent by the Union. Maybe she can help...?
