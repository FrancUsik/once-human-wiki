Also known as the Advanced Synthesis Bench.

Unlocking[]
For the player to be able to build a large hydraulic generator in their territory, they need to unlock the memetic node: Advanced Synthesis Bench (7 cipher,  2000body[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .energy-links-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)}. This memetic node can be found under the Crafting page at the bottom left, and is only unlockable during or after Phase 2: Tame the Staroid.

How To Use[]
For the player to craft the large synthesis bench on their territory they must have unlocked the memetic node (see previous section), and they must have the following materials:

The large synthesis bench is mainly used for making throwables, mixed explosives, HE Grenades, Copper Grenades, Tungsten HE Grenades, and Staroid Resonators. If the player has unlocked the Memetic Specialization: Sulfur Chemist, they can use energy links to craft acid.

Related Specilizations[]
A "Facility Boost" specialization, needs to be built by a character with that specialization to apply. That facility will be created with those enhanced effect baked in. If you have old facilities they will need to be rebuilt. You can also build upgraded facilities in other people's bases (given permissions.) Those players will be able to relocate them freely but demolishing them will require a character with those specializations to rebuild it. Other specializations listed may either be formulas that can be crafted at the facility or specializations that affect the build limit of a base.
