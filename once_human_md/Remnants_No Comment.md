I haven't spoken to you for five years, and now you're suddenly being oh-so-friendly. You think I didn't know you're some kind of journalist?
No, I DON'T know what the hell Rosetta is doing here. That Rosetta spokesperson  said it was a "cutting-edge energy generation facility" that would "solve the energy needs of mankind for the next century." So, just write that! Don't you know how to copy and paste?
As for me, I'm a nobody, just a lowly produce distributor. Rosetta's been building that pylon, and I've made a bit of money out of it. I won't deny that. We've all gotta put food on that table somehow. I also hitched a ride with Mr. Keefer once. It was to supply the large number of engineers, researchers, and military personnel involved in the construction. It's much cheaper to do it this way than for Rosetta to ship their own supplies over from the mainland.
But other than that, there's not much I can tell you.
