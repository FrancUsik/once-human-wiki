Characteristics[]
The torso of the Chagas Weevil Elite Deviant is held mid-air by three unusual hands, with a baby-like corpse hanging from its underbelly. In what can only be described as the creature’s “front,” an arm extends from its neck, ending in appendages that resemble a plant’s stamens but are actually fingers.

Behavior[]
This bizarre creature’s movement is as unsettling as its appearance, often pacing clumsily within its spawning areas. Despite its awkward appearance, when provoked, it becomes highly dangerous—using its arm to generate and throw orbs of concentrated Stardust that seek out and attack its foes.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, target the small glowing “eyeball” at the top of the arm, the bulbous Stardust growths where the limbs intersect, and the sac on its underbelly. When the underbelly sac takes enough damage, it will explode, temporarily stunning this Elite Deviant.

Lore[]
There was once a painter who narrowly escaped the clutches of a Chagas Weevil. Though not physically harmed, he suffered a severe psychological breakdown. Afterward, he became obsessed with painting Deviants, rambling about “becoming the new M.C. Escher” and “capturing the Deviants’ geometric beauty.” His friends and neighbors found this disturbing, eventually banishing him from their settlement. He spent the rest of his life wandering the wilderness.
