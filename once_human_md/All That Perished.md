Trivia[]
It is mentioned by T-Man that Gene Sheckley has left a reward for the Player in his home, however, as there is no additional task guidance and unclear directions, the location of the house and what the reward is is debated among Players.
T-Man mentions that Mr Sheckley "lives in Tall Grass, where he has his own distillery [...]."
