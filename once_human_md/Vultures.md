# Vultures

Vultures are huge threat to players exploring the wilderness. In the world where civilization has collapsed, not everyone is willing to insist their humanity. Some people feel that it is easier to survive by plundering others. This organization of bottomless predators call themselves Vultures.
Vultures are almost undisciplined, raiding other survivalists' strongholds in groups, scavenging for all resources they want. Affected by pollution and drug abuse, Vultures are always in a state of madness and excitement.
