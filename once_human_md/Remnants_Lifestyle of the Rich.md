I don't care about all the silly rumors. I think that Mr. Quinn York is a decent man. He is humble, courteous, and generous. Ever since he took over the Evergreen Vineyard, he's been friendly to everyone, and he hasn't sacked even a single person.
I don't understand what those people have to complain about. They think Mr. York ha some mental problems because he doesn't like the sun and prefers to go out for walks at night. But so what? He's from an old, wealthy family.  he's allowed to be a little eccentric.
