# Securement Silo

Summary[]
Securement Silos (aka "Silos") are short, instance dungeons situated throughout Nalcott island. They are Rosetta facilities containing at least one major enemy that is the focus of activity within a Silo, with the Silo revolving around a historical moment that is usually explained to you by T-Man, a bounty organizer that can be found standing outside every Silo waiting to give you a Bounty task.
Sometimes the main attraction of a Silo is a Deviant and sometimes it is a Rosetta employee.
Every Silo offers the opportunity to secure a Deviation (though not necessarily guaranteed, and multiple completions of a Silo may be required.)

Locations[]
Almost every region of Nalcott has a Silo.
