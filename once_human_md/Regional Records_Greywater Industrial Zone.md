Regional Records/Greywater Industrial Zone[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
In the old days, before the Starfall, this place would have been regarded as a remote settlement. Nowhere to go and nothing  to do, and the heavy clanking of machinery 24 hours a day was enough to give anyone a headache. Even maintenance crews didn't hang around long. Who'd have thought that after the Starfall, this place would become such a prime piece of real estate! Somehow, the oil wells managed to survive relatively intact.
We also found some canned goods - tuna, luncheon meat and so on. Maybe a maintenance crew left them? This place had no restaurant, after all. It was so delicious, I got to thinking - when was the last time I ate canned tuna? Five years ago, at the Union? No, it was three years ago, in the storeroom of that old fast food joint in the Dayton Wetlands.
Anyway, we scoped out the area and didn't find any signs of a bandit presence. We stayed for several days, and didn't see anyone from Rosetta, either. Before we showed up, this place was Nalcott Deviant territory. Maybe the Deviants will come back as soon as we leave, or maybe some poor human survivors will pass through. Either way, I don't expect this place to become a major Stronghold for any faction in the near future. It's a safe distance from Rosetta - unlike the East Blackfell Junction - and resources are more plentiful. It's Melanie's for the taking, in my opinion.
I haven't seen Melanie in such a long time. If only we weren't so busy exploring Nalcott...
