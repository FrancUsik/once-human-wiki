Welcome to the Once Human Wiki, Meta![]

Once Human is a sandbox survival game. Unleashed after the opening of a mysterious inter-dimensional silver door, a substance called Stardust has polluted the world after Starfall, twisting it into a horrific and dangerous landscape. Following a new style, Once Human combines the rationality in science with the mysteries of the unknown. The open-world environment challenges players to survive under the pressure of extreme conditions, otherworldly creatures, and vicious humanity. Gathering resources, building homes, fighting against aberrant monsters, and more, makes it possible to survive the wilderness. Use lethal weapons and cunning tactics to unleash destructive skills to fight your way through to even the toughest of places. You stand as the Meta-Humans confronting all of these ever-changing and still unknown enemies. Explore and earn your spot in a post-apocalyptic world, alone or with friends.
