Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
"We hold dear this native land, whether we once called it home or journeyed far from it's embrace.May 8, 1965 - July 7, 2026"
At the time of writing this, it is July 2, 2031 AD. It has been nearly five years since this sanctuary "passed away."
I do not know the names of those who once lived here. Prior to the Starfall, neither I nor any other members of the expedition had visited this town, nor did we have any ties here. But what I do know is that those people must have deeply cherished the land beneath their feet, for I have witnessed: the fields that had been meticulously tilled, the walls of living rooms decorated with stickers, vibrant lights, love, and patience, the verses carved by guards on the door frames during damp or chilling nights, and the small tombstone dedicated to this town.
All of this has slowly faded and become indiscernible amidst the encroaching erosion of Stardust. It is truly a shame that we never crossed paths with these people. Had we arrived when it was still a town in flames, the Union would have surely gained another dependable ally in the south of Nalcott Island.
Where did these people go? Are they dead or still alive? Might we still chance upon each other in our unknown journeys ahead?
