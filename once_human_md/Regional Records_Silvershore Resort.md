# Regional Records/Silvershore Resort

Silvershore Resort[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
"Silvershore"... My pen trembles between my fingers, tears brimming in my eyes...
Silvershore was my home, where I spent my childhood as a young girl, where my father and mother had had their laughs, their sorrows, their solace, and finally, their burial. And now it is just Silvershore Resort, a mere geographic remark under the tip of my pen since it has been deserted after the Starfall, with no survivors.
My teammates under how I feel, and they explore these ruins carefully, showing their respect. I appreciate their understanding, but ti's not necessary, since the departed are gone, but the living must live on. I've fathered the firearms and communication in my father's safe, and the last few pieces of jewelry left by my mother in her hidden compartment. I love you, Dad and Mom, so I will make good use of these things you've left behind and carry on.
Farewell, my home.
