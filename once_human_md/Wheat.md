Obtaining[]
Wheat can be gathered from the wilderness, and can be grown by planting Wheat Seeds. Wheat seeds can be found by random chance when gathering Wheat from the wilderness, or from the Fetch-A-Lot Bunny, if this deviation is placed inside an Isolated Securement Unit in the player's territory.

Planting[]
Wheat Seeds can be planted in Loamy Soil or Planter Boxes, they take 6 hours to mature and need an irrigation level between 50 - 90, and a light level between 70 - 100. For more information on how to cultivate this plant, see the page Seeds and Agriculture.
