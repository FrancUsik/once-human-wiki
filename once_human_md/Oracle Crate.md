Oracle Crate


	
		
		
	
	An Oracle Crate located at Fort Obsidian




Oracle Crates are unique crates that can only be found during the Lunar Oracle event, between the in-game time of 9pm to 3am. Oracle Crates give players the opportunity to gain event specific resources, as well as high-level weapons and armor.
Oracle Crates can be located by the red orb and trail floating above the crate. Players can unlock the Oracle Crate either without using Lunar Whispers or they can part with 40 of them for guaranteed high value loot items.

Loot Items[]
Opening Oracle Crates gives the player a chance to receive:

Rubies
Lunar Mods
Animals
Animal Hides
Rare Variation Deviations
Moon Whisper
Weapon Blueprints
Armor Blueprints
Note: There is a limit to the number of legendary items the player can receive from Oracle Crates per day. After 20 legendary items have been received, the Oracle Crates will no longer drop legendary items.
