Summary[]
Teleportation Towers are located all around Nalcott. In order for a player to teleport freely between them they must have first unlocked the designated tower; to do this the player must travel to it either on foot, by vehicle, or by teleporting to a friends/Hive member's territory close by. Once the player has arrived they must interact with the tower to activate it. Player's can see which towers are activated and which ones aren't by either looking at the color of the lights on the tower, red means it is locked, and blue means it is unlocked, or by looking at their map, blue icons show that the tower is active and ready to be teleported to, gray icons indicate the tower has not been activated and cannot be teleported to.

Teleportation[]
To teleport between towers the player must be at a teleportation tower, or inside of their territory / Hive territory / friends territory, or at a settlement. To teleport to different locations the player must spend  Energy Linksbody[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .energy-links-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)}, the cost varies depending on how far away the player is to the next tower, for example: a player teleporting across the map could cost between  500-700

Changing Worlds[]
At an unlocked teleport tower the player can press 'G' to look at the selection of worlds within their server, to change the player must select a world and hold down the interaction key. The screen will 'glitch' as a artistic signal that the world has changed. Changing worlds costs no energy links.
The player can see which world they are currently on, and which world their territory is placed. A small home symbol in the bottom right corner of the world signifies the player's territory, and the player icon represents which world the player is on.
