The Eve of Evolution[]
The Eve of Evolution is the first Storyline task the player receives after creating their character.

Find The Password[]
Awakening inside a lab, the player is first tasked with exploring and finding the password to the door located in front of them, up a set of stairs. On the ground lies a Rosetta Researcher with all of their bones broken and no signs of life, upon interacting with the researcher the player will read a note:
DEVIATION A-073 FILE 1"Note: Subject A-073 is an adult human. Ethnicity: ■■■■, gender: ■■■■, identity unknown. Subject's body has been in a state of stasis ever since being recovered from ■■■■ following ■■■■■■■■■■■. The cause for reappearance is still unknown. Subject has been impaled by an object made of an unknown material, with likely origins in Rift Space. Subject has been placed in an isolation compartment as per safety protocols."
Next the player can interact with a note on the table opposite the researcher: 
DEVIATION A-073 SECUREMENT MEMO"A-073 Project Secure Notice:Access code for Chrono Cage experiment area must be changed daily. Today's code for D-23 Experiment Day is 0728. The code has been updated and confirmed by the supervisor Jing III - S0641. Update the code after completing today's experiment plan. Be informed." This note tells the player the password they need for the door, and the player can locate the passcode lock to the right of the door, inputting the code from the A-073 Memo note to open it.

Find The Access Card[]
The player's next task is to find an access card that they need to use in order to obtain their first Cradle. When entering the next room another Rosetta researcher can be found laying on the floor, interacting with this researcher will give the player the A-073 Access Card, and 2 sanity gummies. The player will also be able to read the note:
DEVIATION A-073 FILE 2"Note: An intact Cradle was recovered near Subject A-073, with a design and manufacture consistent with those used by the Mayflies. Energy stored within the Cradle shows unusual signs of activity, and seems to become more volatile when near Subject A-073. The Cradle has been placed in a separate room for safekeeping until more research can be conducted."
Using the access card on the room next to the researcher will open the locked doors, where the player can then go inside and be taken into a cut scene. This is the first time the player meets V, and are prompted to "Talk to this strange bird". V and the player will talk to one another, with the player being able to choose which dialog options they wish to say. After this conversation, a portal opens, and the player can proceed to the next task.

Explore The Monolith Interior[]
This is the first time the player is introduced to some of the main mechanics of the game:

"Q" to use Spacetime
RMB to perform heavy melee attacks
"H" to holster a weapon
"N" to toggle the flashlight
Hunger, hydration, and sanity
The player will come across a Weapon Crate, containing a Machete, and 2 Activators, in the first room. Leaving this room, the player will fight a Watcher, 2 Gnawers, and find another weapon crate, this time containing a Molotov Cocktail, and a Gear Crate, containing a Rustic Hat and 2 Shabby Fabric. Up the stairs lays a Rosetta guard, who has the note:
DEVIATION A-07 FILE 3"Note: This is a Priority Alpha research operation. Any findings related to it or Project Butterfly must be directly reported to ■■■■. This operation has been designated top secret. Any personnel who violate its confidentiality will be subject to termination."
After reading this note, the player can continue into a portal to the left of the guard, where they will find:

Gear Crate: 1x Rustic Shoes, 2x Canned Lunch Meat
Enemy: 1x Gnawer
Item Crate: 2x Canned Lunch Meat, 4x Boiled Water
Deviation Observation Report note
After-Image
Touch The After-Image[]
After touching the after image that stands in front of the monolith's entrance/exit, the player will load into another area to continue the quest.

Investigate The Area[]
Player's are prompted to use their Spacetime ability to investigate the new area, where they will come across three Spatial Theaters, each giving the player some background on the lore of the game.

Explore This Space Further[]
After watching and listening to the spatial theaters the player will be given a waypoint in a different room, where they will encounter:

Gear Crate: 1x Rustic Gloves, 2x Shabby Fabric, 2x Boiled Water
Enemy: 2x Agent, 2x Gnawer
Deviation: 1x Butterfly's Emissary
Secure Butterfly Emissary[]
After eliminating the enemies, the player is tasked with securing the Butterfly Emissary, a deviation. This is done by walking over to the deviation and pressing "F".

Touch The After-Image Again[]
After successfully securing the deviation, the After-Image from before will reappear, and the player will be prompted to touch it again. This results in another cut scene.

Enter The House[]
The player exits the Rift Space for the first time, where they are met by Mitsuko for the first time. 

you will be gliding through the air. Use the opportunity to land in a location that has all the resources you need for initial base construction. If you are on a PVP server, land in a location that will be easiest to defend.
