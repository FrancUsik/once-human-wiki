Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Unexpectedly, a Rosetta official reached out to us, a woman calling herself Hannah. She said she was the commander of this depot, overseeing the security and logistics supplies here.
She walked into our camp, unarmed and alone, but she seemed to give off elegance with every movement. She gladly accepted my lunch invitation and openly scrutinized the coffee, oatcakes, cheese, bacon, and everything on the table. She frowned slightly, sizing up my expedition team and the Union behind us. The Union's entire supply system - production, distribution, and scale - must be crystal clear to her now.
Not that I can really blame her for doing this. I've been spending a lot of time trying to size up Rosetta, after all. Ms. Hannah's visit cost us at least half a week's worth of food (of course we had to send her off with decent goodbye gifts to show our goodwill). We'll have to tighten our belts for a few days now. Other than that, I think our luncheon went pretty smoothly, even "flawlessly." We didn't give away the Union's secret, after all.
Amelia and Larry came back later after Ms. Hannah left. Just as we guessed, this depot had been set up to fortify the south coast. its previous residents, if there were any, were ejected or kindly "re-settled" long ago by Rosetta.
Not a good place to linger. We'd better get out of here.
