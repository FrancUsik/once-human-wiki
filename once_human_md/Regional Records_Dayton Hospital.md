Regional Records: Dayton Hospital[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
The Dayton Hospital, built by Rosetta to support the Monolith construction project, is located right nice to the Monolith itself. No one could set foot in there without a Rosetta name badge. The doctors and nurses, the sick and wounded patients, and even the security guards were all Rosetta personnel. Even the other buffer zone was out of bounds to locals (unless you were one of the lucky few with a special "connection").
There is one thing that I just can't get my head around, though. Trent Palmieri claimed that he had worked here before the catastrophe. He provided a lot of information about the Monolith and Stardust Infection to a local contact with the aim of exposing Rosetta's dastardly deeds (ultimately it didn't make much of a difference). I believe what he said is true, but, well, it's hard for me to imagine how someone as frail and dorky-looking as Trent could pull off espionage like that in the heavily guarded Rosetta Hospital. For starters, how did he manage to slip past Rosetta's tight security?
Anyway, things are different now. No one from Rosetta is still active around here. The place has become pretty heavily polluted by Stardust, and thanks to the Monolith, it's likely to stay that way. As for us, we performed as simple search to gather supplies, then cleared out as quickly as we could.
