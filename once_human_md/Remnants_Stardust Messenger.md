# Remnants/Stardust Messenger

Stardust Messenger[]
"The Incisor" Hulda, Marauder
Mount Guel Power, Southwest Chalk Peak
August 18, ▮▮29
We got our asses handed to us by one unarmed dude today. We were just gonna rob hm, but he fought back, and the whole thing was over so fast that I don't even really know how it happened. I thought he'd kill us, but he didn't. The dud said his name was Black King, and that he'd come from the mountains up normal. Those mountains are supposed to be crawling with mutant beasts and Deviants. If it weren't for his incredible combat skills, I wouldn't have believed anyone could survive in a place like that.
We got talking, and ended up inviting Marcus - or should I say Mr. Clark - to our camp. He sat with us, and even shared some bread and jerky. Turns out he's part of some new region, our spreading the "word of Stardust" and recruiting new members. Mr. Clark told us they had a whole bunch of these "messengers," and offered to take us back to their settlement in Chalk Peak.
