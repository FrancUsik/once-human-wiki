So Much Has Changed[]
Trent Palmieri, Union Physician
Meyer's Market, East Broken Delta
April 5, ▮▮33
It's such a pity that I was never able to meet Simon Meyer in person.
I remember leading a convoy into Sandbank sometime last year. Our radio equipment suddenly broke down, and we lost communication with Blackfell. We didn't know anything about Sandback either, but we stopped here for a rest, and were shocked when we stumbled upon Simon Meyer's freshly dug grave...
Fortunately, the people of Sandbank held their ground. This town has got some amazing fighters, just as good as the Union's men - oh wait, that's right. They're part of the Union now too.
Mr. Dave Joyce (or Mayor Dave, as he goes by these days) is a great leader too. I meet him a few times, many years ago, in Brookham. Back then, he was just a hardware salesman, and if you ask me, he seemed like a real spineless kiss-up back then. He says he has no memory of these meetings, and also denies he ever sold hardware... Well, whatever. Maybe I confused him for someone else. After all, that was all sixteen years ago. So much has changed since then.
