Come At Me, Then[]
Melanie: So why are you here?
Arno I-S1134: Rosetta would appreciate your assistance. In return, you'll receive a monthly shipment of food and guns.
Melanie: My assistance? I thought Rosetta was omnipotent.
Arno I-S1134: It is, but according to corporate regulations, current survivors on the surface are eligible to provide assistance to the organization..
Melanie: It's funny, you didn't expect any of us to survive, did you?
Arno I-S1134: Melanie Gold, I recommend you seriously consider our offer. After all, your supplies won't last forever.
Melanie: I've already considered it. If we agreed, we'd become human shields for Rosetta. Mayor Sutton already made that dumb mistake.
Arno I-S1134: Very well. But if you refuse Rosetta's request, then you should understand the consequences.
Melanie: Come at me, then. I'm not afraid.
