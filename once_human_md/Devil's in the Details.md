Warning of an Attack[]
Attention, this is not a drill! We are under attack by the Meta-Humans! It can be confirmed that Base Commander Ames has betrayed Rosetta! All personnel should immediately take refuge inside the institute! The good news is, we are all members of the Advent Sect here, so let's unite! We must hold down the fort until the main suppression force arrives and wipes out those traitors!

Research Progress Stalled[]
As expected, among all the facilities on Nalcott Island, the Gaia Institute is nothing more than a cold outpost for the Advent Sect. In today's world, where the Meta-Human's are in power, them supporting our research is definitely out of the question. After all, we should already be grateful that they haven't rounded us up and dealt with us by now. Anyway, there's really nothing worth seeing in the Gaia Cliff Monolith. This "prison" has been empty for years, devoid of any Rift Entities for us to study. A far cry from the Monolith of Thirst in the west and the Monolith of Nightmares in the north--God, how I envy the researches there... It's so galling when I think about that. Alright, rant over, back to work. Working late until 11:00PM again. (Thanks a lot, Commander Ames.)

Secret Report[]
In light of the unusual events occurring at the Nalcott base recently. I hereby request the headquarters put the area under closer monitoring. There has been no definitive update on the whereabouts of Mr. Ames for more than 36 hours after his visit to the site. It's highly likely that Mr. Ames has been killed, and I'm certain the Mary Ames, the commander of the Nalcott base, is the prime suspect. No matter what happened here, it means that a dramatic conflict has broken out within the Evolution Sect, which could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Advent Sect to rebuild itself. I will keep monitoring the situation and report any further developments at the Nalcott base.
