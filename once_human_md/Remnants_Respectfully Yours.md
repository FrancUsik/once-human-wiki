What am I doing? Following orders, of course! Yes, I was the one who shot Matriarch Joanne, but it were her and those Matriarchs who gave the order! We don't allow anyone to enter here form the west, so it behooves us not to allow anyone to leave here form the east.
Think about it, Captain Ralph, there's a plague going on in Greenlake Hill, and we're lucky to be able to survive replying on the supplies in the bunker now. Letting people in or passing through is a huge risk. The Matriarchs have taught us that we need not shed tears and sorrow for anyone other than ourselves. We should be honoring that teaching.
