Large Refinery Facility[]
Enhanced Refining Facility that can purify fuel more efficiently.
The large refinery facility is the second and final refinery, only possible to build if the player has unlocked the Memetic Specialization: Large Refinery Facility. If the player did not get the aforementioned specialization they can request another player to build one on their territory. Note: be careful when giving other players permission to your territory.
This refinery will allow players to convert Portable Mixed Fuel into Barreled Premium Fuel at a rate of 25:1 every 30 minutes. Additionally, this specilization allows players to transform Acid into Portable Mixed Fuel at a rate of 10:5 every 30 minutes. Requiring 15 Watts of electricity.
