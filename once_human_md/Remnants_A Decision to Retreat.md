There is no way we can undo the pollution that Stardust has brought upon us. No matter how many precautions we've taken. We've lost two loyal members of the team this week. Such sacrifices are meaningless and I can't risk my people any longer! Tomorrow, I will lead them back to Centipede Nest. If the higher-ups blame us, I will take the responsibility.
These cursed mountains are not our land. If it was up to me, I would have left already. Now, I only hope that Miyako is doing better in the south. It's been weeks since I've gotten in touch with her. I hope she's still doing ok.
