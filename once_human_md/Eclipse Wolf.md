Summary[]
Wolves are aggressive animals that can be slain for Beast Meat, or captured for animal breeding. 

Description[]
Wolves are highly social and intelligent animals, well-known for their strong pack mentality and cooperative hunting strategies.

Locations[]
Wolves are commonly found in Red Sands.

How to Capture[]
[See: Ranching]

Taming[]
Once a wolf has been captured, Players can place them inside their territory, along with an animal trough that has food and water inside it. Food and water may also be discarded on the ground. Wolves have a diet of meat; their favorite foods consist of large chunks of meat such as Deer Meat.
Tameness increases as the animal's hydration and hunger meters increase above 30%. Their tameness will decrease if their hydration and hunger meters reach 0%.
Wolves do not give off any byproducts.
If slaughtered, wolves will provide the Player with Beast Meat and Wolf Hide.

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Corrupted Wolf[]
[See: Corrupted Wolf]

Description[]
At first, these Eclipse Seed species could be said to be benefiting form Stardust, because they are able to evolve into stronger, more powerful version of themselves. However, when the level of Stardust in the body exceeds a certain threshold, a backlash begins.
Stardust's sole purpose is to keep spreading, and it does not benefit from being too highly concentrated in any particular life form. After a certain point, Stardust will therefore beginning to consume the infected life form from the inside out, eating away at the host, and spraying tiny Stardust particles into the surrounding air like a plant dispersing its seed.
This is what happened to many of the Mutant Wolves who roam the wilderness - mangy and worn down, with little to no remaining fur.

Locations[]
Corrupted Wolves can spawn randomly in various locations across Nalcott.

How to Capture[]
Corrupt Wolves cannot be captured.

Taming[]
