# Ammunition

Ammunition (ammo) is among the first few things that V will task you with obtaining during the story quests. All gun types have their respected ammo type, acquired by crafting them at either a primary, intermediate, or advanced supplies workbench, or by looting Storage Crates. Different tier ammunition have differing amount of damage, PSI intensity, and material cost. Higher tier ammunition can be obtained through higher tier Memetics such as Ammunition I, Ammunition II, and Ammunition III, for non-AP ammunition, and Advanced Ammunition I, Advanced Ammunition II, and Advanced Ammunition III, for AP ammunition, and other special types including grenades and Canisters.
There are 6 different basic types of ammunition for the corresponding 6 different types of guns: 

Pistol
Shotgun
Submachine Gun (SMG)
Rifle
Sniper Rifle (SR)
Light Machine Gun (LMG)
Additionally, there are 2 special types of ammunition: Arrows for both the Crossbow and Bow, and grenades for Heavy Weapons. When crafting ammunition, there are set amounts the player will get per queued item set to craft in the queue.
