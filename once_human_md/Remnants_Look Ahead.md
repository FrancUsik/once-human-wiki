Mining Town, West Chalk Peak

I don't care what anyone else thinks. All I know is, this town has been on life support ever since the mining jobs started to dry up. But now, thanks to Rosetta, it's like everyone's come back to life.
That Monolith has brought in jobs. For the first time in years, people have actually got some money to spend. And I don't see the work drying up any time soon. Blackfell Oil and Gas? That's old new, man. People used to swagger around wearing their old mining uniforms as a badge of pride. And I can understand that. But it's time to face up to the fact that those days are long gone. That Monolith can generate unlimited amounts of pollution-free, cost-free energy. The age of petroleum is over. We've gotta look to the future, right?
