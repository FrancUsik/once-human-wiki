# Remnants/Will of Stardust

Will of Stardust[]
White King, Grand Priest
The Boss's Playground, Northeast Chalk Peak
August 14, ▮▮36
The cleanup is done. All useful supplies, tools, and equipment have been loaded and transported. This orchard is now ready to serve its new purpose as another base. Marcus and the other followers haven't raised any further objections, but I know they still regret abandoning such a well-located and well-equipped stronghold. At least everyone complied with this.
Next, we'll hand this place over to another group of followers. They were once hunters in the wilderness, but after witnessing our strength, they sincerely repented, for they realized how puny humans were and that they could never escape their fate as prey.
Let this orchard now be their new home.
