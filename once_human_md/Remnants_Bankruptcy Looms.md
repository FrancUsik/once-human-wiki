Bankruptcy Looms[]

I'm aware that recently there have been many rumors circulating, claiming that we have lost the support of the bank, our financial resources have been severed, and the entire resort is on the verge of bankruptcy. Today, I've come here to clarify something to everyone--
The rumors are true. Rosetta has acquired all the land nearby, and we will be next. I'm sorry, everyone, we have failed. I've already started sending out job applications, and I encourage all of you to do the same.
