"Love in the Morning" is a moviecompletely worth watching, mysterious but warm, unafraid to explore taboos. It does make you feel like that love is like the morning sun, no, more than that, love is like a burst of dazzling sunshine after dawn.
The film portrays it so powerfully, with love transcending race and identity. It has been a long time since a movie took on this possibly trite subject in so daring a way, giving romance an unvarnished look instead of simply reducing it to cliche.
