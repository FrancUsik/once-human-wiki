The BL1103C project is coming to an end. Just wait for the right opportunity, and everything that's been suppressed will come alive...
Before that, we need to be ready to evacuate at any time. For this unified operation, Rosetta expanded its enrollment on Nalcott Island, and the current number of personnel used to establish the base has far exceeded planned estimates. The underground base obviously cannot meet the needs of all Rosetta personnel, so it seems some trade-offs need to be made.
