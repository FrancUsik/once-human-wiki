It's not in the bylaws, and I hope you never have to use this knowledge, but... if the worse ever does happen, I want you to remember this, my idiot brother...
Don't panic if you see a yellow, red, or purple light come on. Just follow the procedures issued by the company. I know it seems silly, but trust me, it works.
But, but! BUT!!! If you see a blue light come on (an employee with your clearance shouldn't ever see a blue light, but I added it for you, just in case), then I need you to get the hell out of there ASAP. On the roof, there's a Rosetta helicopter and some supplies I've prepared for you. If the helicopter doesn't work, find the nearest car that still works (if it's not your car, smash the window with your gun if ou need to), then hit the gas and drive to the fishing port on the eastern side of Rippleby. You only have 45 minutes, and if you miss it, you'll be stuck on this crappy island forever.
