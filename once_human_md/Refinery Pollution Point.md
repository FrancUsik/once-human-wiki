Summary[]
Refinery Pollution Point is located in Iron River at 5274,-3699.

History[]
Before the Starfall, there used to be a fleet of trucks working around the clock, taking finished goods to customers, and bringing in raw materials for smelting in the factory. It was only a medium-sized refinery at best, but it did good business and paid its workers a fair wage. It was late at night when Stardust first spread to the refinery, and there were only a few kids on guard duty at the time. They didn't stand a chance. Some of them probably wander the halls of the refinery even now, in a new, twisted form... &#91;1&#93;
The refinery was abandoned after the Starfall, and now stands empty.
