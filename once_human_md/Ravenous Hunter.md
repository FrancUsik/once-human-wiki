Deviant Archive[]
The Ravenous Hunter Great One resides in an Almit-class Rift Space within Monolith BL082W. 
This Rift Space was activated in 2047 using a Stardust equivalent of approximately 75,000 units. The internal structure of the Rift Space is a variant of the Rift Space that once existed in the nearby Dayton Wetlands sewage plant. The building's structure has been affected by the Ravenous Hunter's movement characteristics, resulting in a spatial distribution that violates the laws of physics.
Any personnel entering the Rift Space must pay close attention to the actions of the Great Once, in particular the launch of tracking missiles and other explosives, as well as its gelatinous head.

Attacks[]
Minigun Burst: focuses on a nearby player and aims its minigun at them, releasing a several-second-long burst of bullets. This is its primary method of attack.
Teleportation: approaching too close to Ravenous Hunter will cause it to teleport away and fire another Minigun Burst.
Stomp: approaching too close to Ravenous Hunter after it teleports will cause it to stomp and knock away any nearby players.
Festering Spray: spews several instances of festering gel around the area, causing the affected ground to inflict damage over time to any players stepping in it.
Spawner Spawn: after destroying two chunks of Ravenous Hunter's health bar it will cause two Gnawer Spawn points to appear on the left and right side of the arena that must be destroyed before it is vulnerable again.
Sniper Rifle: while the two Gnawer Spawners are still up Ravenous Hunter will take a position at the far end of the arena, lining up explosive sniper shots on players within its line of sight.
Missile Salvo: when Ravenous Hunter is in its final phase of two remaining health bars it will trade out its minigun for a rocket launcher, firing either a tracking salvo of missiles or a burst of several area-of-effect missiles that will target the ground closest to the targeted player.
[Hard/Pro Mode Only] Shadow Sniper: After the Gnawer Spawners are destroyed Ravenous Hunter will create a low-health Shadow of itself at the far platform that performs its explosive Sniper Rifle attack independently. It can be destroyed with concentrated fire.
[Hard/Pro Mode Only] Shadow Rocket Launcher: After the Gnawer Spawners are destroyed Ravenous Hunter will create a low-health Shadow of itself at the initial platform that performs its Missile Salvo ground-targeted attack independently. This attack is extremely deadly as the amount of missiles is greatly increased in Hard Mode.
Strategy[]
General Tips[]
There is ample cover around the center of the arena to stay behind while Ravenous Hunter attacks, and it has long cooldown periods between Minigun Bursts that provide opportunities to counterattack.
Ravenous Hunter's Weak point is its gelatinous head.
There are many Explosive Barrels around the arena that can be thrown with Telekinetic Hand to deal high amounts of damage to Ravenous Hunter or the Gnawer Spawners.
Upon destroying a chunk of health the Ravenous Hunter will drop its minigun, which can be picked up with Telekinetic Hand and wielded to inflict consisted damage on it.
Position yourself on either the left or right-most side of the arena before phasing the boss past two chunks of its health bar so you can easily avoid its Sniper Rifle attack and easily destroy the Gnawer Spawners.
Try to save your Deviation for Ravenous Hunter's final phase, as the rocket launcher attacks can be devastating to lower-leveled players.
Long Range[]
Upon spawning in the arena do not go down the stairs, instead take a position behind the pillars to the left or right of the stairs and damage the boss safely between its attacks.
Both Gnawer Spawners are visible from the staircase, ensuring that you do not need to expose yourself for long to destroy them and make Ravenous Hunter vulnerable again.
If you have enough ammunition, you do not need to worry about picking up explosive barrels or its minigun.
This method is recommended for lower level players as it is the most defensive way of fighting Ravenous Hunter.
Medium Range[]
Make use of the four points of cover to the left and right down the stairs from the initial spawn point of the arena to intercept Ravenous Hunter's attacks.
Make ample use of the explosive barrels, especially to chunk down the Gnawer Spawners and any Gnawers that they create once Ravenous Hunter has been phased.
Close Range[]
Stick to the four points of cover around the center of the arena as Ravenous Hunter stalks side to side to attack players.
Make sure to dodge behind cover as Minigun Bursts and Missile Salvos target you as hard cover will intercept the attacks.
If you are overleveled wielding a close-range weapon you can likely phase Ravenous Hunter before it can counterattack.
This method is not recommended as Ravenous Hunter will teleport away once players get too close, and after teleporting will perform a stomp that knocks players away and onto their backs. Shotguns and SMGs are still viable, so long as players keep their distance.
Pro Mode Differences[]
Limited Revives: Players will have only 1 Adrenaline Shot each during the encounter.
Ravenous Hunter's Gatling Gun will have a separate health bar initially: this must be depleted before Ravenous Hunter can be targeted directly.
After destroying the Gatling Gun Ravenous Hunter will switch to its Missile Salvo attack immediately.
Ravenous Hunter will fire ground-targeted Missile Salvos at a higher frequency with a much higher amount of missiles. This attack is extremely difficult to avoid and is best sprinted away from, strafing left and right to try to cause it to misfire in a given direction.
Four Gnawer Spawners will be created instead of two; two each on the left and right catwalks on the sides of the arena. These are additionally accompanied by two Arbiters; one each that emerge from portals at the top of the stairs on the left and right.
Black Pools will be created next to each Gnawer Spawner that will drain your Sanity as you stand in them.
Shadow Sniper: After the Gnawer Spawners are destroyed Ravenous Hunter will create a low-health Shadow of itself at the far platform that performs its explosive Sniper Rifle attack independently. It can be destroyed with concentrated fire.
Shadow Rocket Launcher: After the Gnawer Spawners are destroyed Ravenous Hunter will create a low-health Shadow of itself at the initial platform that performs its Missile Salvo ground-targeted attack independently. This attack is extremely deadly as the amount of missiles is greatly increased in Hard Mode.
Weekly Modifiers: Ravenous Hunter is subject to two weekly random modifiers. Check the bottom left of the queue screen to see what is in effect each week.
It is highly recommended that players stay mobile during Ravenous Hunter's Missile Salvo phases and destroy its Shadow Rocket Launcher clone as soon as possible when hitting its final phase as the attack is capable of downing players in one salvo.
It is highly recommended that players save their best burst damage options for the final phase of Ravenous Hunter as it will exclusively use its Missile Salvo attacks. Ideally player will be able to defeat Ravenous Hunter before it can unleash more than one attack.
