No Food[]

There's nothing to eat left in the house, luckily that's the worst that's happened to my wife and I so far.
That blue storm is still raging outside. Here in Cinematown we're always involved in making movies where something strange happens, but now it's real. If it hasn't calmed down outside in three days, we'll need to go out to find food. There is a shopping mall nearby, we should be able to find something there.
