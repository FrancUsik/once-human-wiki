Summary[]
Field Guide/Personnel Files[]
Union Foreman
Dennis Mobley. He runs an oil well for the Union. He's your typical salt-on-the-earth Blackfell type. Serious, don't-to-earth, though as old boots, a true survivor. He just wants to keep on living in the old way, according to his own means. Just like the older generation
And he's not the only one - most of the traditional types have rallied around Dennis. Together, they make up the Union's conservative faction. Those oil well guys are good at what they do, and the oil well props up the economy of the entire eastern region. Because of this, they've become one of the most important factions within the Union.
And Dennis Mobley is their leader.
