I warned the Matriarchs that those grains and beans might be dangerous and should be completely destroyed. However, they ultimately decided to store them all in the granary. Matiarch Joanne believes that after "proper handling," the risk of contaminated food harming the body can be reduced. As for what constitutes "proper handling," only Matriarch Joanne and possibly the spirits know.
Anyway, starting next month, I won't touch the rationed food in the common cafeteria, and I won't let Daisy eat it either. But we need to come up with a good excuse... We still have some stockpiled food from last year, enough to sustain us for a while. We'll have to see how the others react before deciding on your next steps.
