Summary[]
Mary is a member of â€œThe Nine", one of the most powerful Meta-Humans, ranked No.8. Because of the abnormal "Impure" in her body, she has obtained the power of a Beyonder, and can release a large number of deadly toxins, which is extremely destructive. As head of Rosetta's Special Response Team, Mary conducts an endless hunt of Mayflies and the Meta-Humans who want to escape from Rosetta's control.

Mary was born in an underground bunker somewhere. Like all Rosetta children born after the Starfall, her birth was completely artificial, from fertilization to delivery.
She has no idea who her parents (or rather, the "sperm and egg providers") are, obviously. She received more education than most of the grunts she was born alongside, though. They must have seen something in her.
Most teenagers go through a rebellious phase, but with Mary, it turned serious. In the end, she turned her back on the whole Rosetta organization and came to join us.
During that operation, she was dispatched to a safe zone as a key researcher. She was supposed to go pick up the larvae, who where just coming to. But, that's not quite who it panned out.
