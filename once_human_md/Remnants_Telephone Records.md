Silvershore Resort, Southwest Chalk Peak
June 6, ▮▮19
Yes, this is Silvershore Resort. We intend to sell two towing vehicles, both 2004 models from Doug's. The engine and chassis are in excellent condition. Feel free to come and test-drive them if you're interested. es, Mr. Cooper also has some properties and assets he's looking to sell. No, the resort itself is not on the list. The houses and land are not for sale! I made it clear, Mr. Cooper is busy and won't agree. No, I'm not looking for a job either. Forget it, goodbye.
