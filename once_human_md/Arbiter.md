Characteristics[]
The Arbiter Elite Deviant is among several beings that can evolve when a Stardust infection intensifies. Its morphology reflects this progression, with one massively oversized arm and a reinforced torso designed to support the arm’s increased weight, which is covered in bulbous, Stardust-filled growths.
Arbiters appear in both standard Elite Deviant size and a larger Titan variant, which can reach at least twice the average size. The evolution path an infected individual undergoes is influenced by both its physical condition and environment.

Behavior[]
The Arbiter’s ultra-strong arm is its primary weapon, used for powerful swings during attacks. The weight imbalance gives the Arbiter a distinctive, galloping motion as it pursues prey. Beyond arm swings, Arbiters are known to charge and lunge at targets, using the momentum of their massive bodies to maximize impact.

Tips[]
Target the bulbous Stardust growths on the Arbiter’s back to inflict maximum damage.
