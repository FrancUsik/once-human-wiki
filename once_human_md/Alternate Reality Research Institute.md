Summary[]
Alternate Reality Research Institute is located in Red Sands at 6867,-1617.

History[]
Alternate Reality Research Institute is among the most secretive Rosetta facilities on Nalcott Island. It's tucked away in a river valley on the far eastern edge of the Red Sands, nowhere near any major settlements, and it doesn't even appear on pre-Starfall maps. Rumor has it they conducted extreme experiments on how stardust and Great Ones might distort time and space. These studies involve stardust, Rift Entities, and maybe even the boundaries of reality itself... &#91;1&#93;
