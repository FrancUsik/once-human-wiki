It's really strange. Rosetta acquired the entire valley and started some kind of Monolith project. I was sure I was about to be "optimized" out of a job, but then, I got told that I was being "included in the external maintenance personnel group."
I guess I shouldn't complain too much. After all, I've managed to keep my job (it's not easy to find a new one at my age). Besides, I don't actually have much to do every day. I just sit in a corner of the construction site, reading newspapers, scrolling social media, and even taking the odd afternoon nap. The only discomfort I feel is this persistent itch on my back.
I hope it's not an abscess. I've even started to see these blue streaks in the mirror. I've decided to take a trip to the clinic at Paisley Plaza next week and get it checked out.
