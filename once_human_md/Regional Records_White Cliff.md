Regional Records/White Cliff[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
White Cliff is one of the most impenetrable military bases on Nalcott Island. It's Rosetta's military hub on the island, run by their top researchers and protected like a fortress.
From afar, it doesn't look like ruins. Instead, it exudes an icy, mechanical precision. Tall metal walls run along the perimeter, with defense towers flashing warning lights at every high point, and turret guns silently sweeping the horizon. The buildings have a heavily industrial style--steel and concrete in layered defenses, with not a single inch of space wasted.
At its center stands a large lab building, covered in high-energy protective materials. It has no windows, just a massive alloy door that armed researchers pass through now and then. They wear advanced Rosetta protective suits, and even the stationed soldier instinctively keep their distance.
"What could they be researching?" People are guessing all kinds of things, but Rosetta hasn't said a word--just sent their top armed unit to guard the place. We don't know if any of the rumors are true, but one thing's for sure: White Cliff is getting ready for something big. And whatever it is, it could change the future of Nalcott Island.
