... Peas, 358 grams. They are a little moldy, but should still be edible. Last week it rained, Uncle Wendell and Aunt Harriet helped collect the mushrooms that grow under the house, which according to my aunt are edible. We dried them and saved them for emergencies. I also found some fruits, but when I cut them open, they had a bit of a blueish glow. I didn't want to risk it. I don't think cooking can remove the poison. That's all.
Maybe we can try bark porridge. I've heard that elm bark tastes kind of sweet if you grind it into flour, but it's not good for old people stomachs... Leather belts can also be made into soup...
