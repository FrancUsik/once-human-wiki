Poor old Jeff. Having to go through the rest of this life without his thing.
Vanessa never banned this kind of thing, but people still ought to consider the consequences of their actions Now, we're stuck with two weakened gunmen who are no longer in combat shape. And Jeff has to take the blame for that.
The funny thing is, if he wasn't so self-indulgent - if he came and asked me for help first, I would have been happy to give him a coupe of oil-soaked mutant wolf bladders. But now, all I can do is make sure I sew him up properly.
