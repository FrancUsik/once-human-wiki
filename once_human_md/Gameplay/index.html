<h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay<a class="headerlink" href="#gameplay" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In the game "Once Human," players will plunge into a challenging and brutal world. Players need to use all the resources to improve their abilities, set their own territory, and defeat powerful monsters, huge secret organizations, and corruption. In addition, players can engage in in-depth social interactions with other players, build their common home, or compete for valuable resources.</p>
<p>You are the survivalist in the wilderness[]
Most of the land, under the pollution of Stardust, has become a wild area that is difficult to be used by human beings, and is spread all over the teratogens and dangerous creatures. In such a harsh environment, the surveyors must be 100 times careful to obtain available materials from polluted water and soil and survive for a minute and a second.</p>
<p>You are the soldier fighting against the catastrophe[]
The Stardust catastrophe has spawned countless monsters, which have occupied almost the whole world. We must recover the homeland of mankind from them! Although the metamorphosis has always regarded humans as prey, now, transcendent, we have you... It's time for you to become a hunter.</p>
<p>You are the builder of civilization[]
Yes, brick by brick, from a house to a town, and finally, the civilized society of mankind. Thirty years of grief almost annihilated the remaining human memory of the past, but you still remember. You should tell the latecomers about the prosperity and lead them to recreate it.</p>
<p>You are the transcendent of human evolution[]
What is the truth of the catastrophe? Is there any secret to completely curing dust pollution in the mysterious Rosetta base? To know this, relying on one person's strength is not enough. You need to gather all those who share the same ideals - transcendent and ordinary human beings - to explore the mysteries of destruction and evolution.</p>
<p>PVE BOSS[]
In multiplayer PVE mode, the Great Ones are powerful monsters. They try to invade the world where the player is located. Multiple players are required to form a team to fight against it. Usually, 2~4 players are recommended. The Great Ones are distributed in different areas of the map. After completing the initial challenge of Big Ones, players can unlock higher-level challenges of Big Ones. Depending on the level and difficulty, the player who kills the Great Ones can get rewards like firearms blueprints and equipment.  </p>
<p>Raid[]
The difficult dungeon is called Raid in the game. Compared with the Challenge of Big Ones, the Raid has a longer process, richer level interaction mechanism, more interesting background story, higher numerical difficulty, and rare rewards. Raid has three levels. Players need to team up to complete the mission of each level (killing Big Ones, protecting targets, obtaining items, etc.) to clear the stage. Each level has corresponding rewards; the final reward can be obtained after completing the dungeon. In addition to general rewards, Raid also provides limited firearm blueprints and limited rare development material.</p>
<p>Missions[]
In addition to the above-mentioned PVE mode, Once Human provides various tasks. Players can explore the big world according to the main quests and learn about the dramatic stories behind Rosetta and Mayfly. Besides, players can take various side quests like hunting powerful aberrations or containing abnormal items that cause pollution and spread or work with other players to solve the timed crisis events to remove the threat to humanity. Players can gain a lot of experience and in-game tokens by completing various tasks.</p>
<p>Introduction to PVP Mode[]
Stronghold Contest[]
In the game, players can form a team called a Warband with a maximum number of 50 teammates. After creating a Warband, players can compete for various resource areas in the game. After occupying the resource area, they can obtain rare materials for strengthening weapons and equipment for a long time. Players can also launch attacks on resource areas occupied by other Warbands. After initiating a war, they can organize manpower to attack the target area. If the attacker successfully destroys the beacons protected by the defender within a limited time, they will seize the dominance of the resource area.
In addition to obtaining stable resource income by occupying the resource area, players can also receive season rewards. At the end of each season, the system will issue rewards to each Warband according to their rank number. </p>
<p>Impasse Exploration[]
Impasse Exploration is the PvEvP mode. Desperate is the most polluted area in the game, so even the Beyonders are difficult to keep sane in it. But Impasse has valuable materials that are difficult to obtain in other ways. In Desperate, players can get rare material, "Chaotic Cortex," by killing aberrations and elites. Through the purification facility hidden in Desperate,  "Chaotic Cortex" can be converted into Source, a precious material used to improve skills and gun attributes. However, "Chaotic Cortex" will all be lost if players die. Also, there are no PVP rules, so the player must always be on guard against attacks from other players to succeed with great rewards.</p>
<p>Territory Construction Rules[]
In the game, players can freely choose locations to build a house for themself. Before building a home, players need to set a territory because only the buildings in the territory can exist for a long time. Players can freely build houses of different styles using different foundations, walls, and ceilings. Players can also share the construction and use rights of the territory with their friends and build a common home.
After setting a territory, players can place various facilities in the house. The acquisition of indoor facilities needs to consume some raw materials. For example, making a table requires a certain amount of wood. Therefore, building a house requires a lot of raw materials that need to be obtained in daily tasks.
In the territory, you can build a garage, workbench, armor bench, equipment bench, stove, and other facilities to obtain personal daily necessities or improve item quality.</p>
<p>Instructions for resource collection, cooking, decomposition, weapon building, and equipment building[]
Players can pick various resources in the game, for example, obtain logs by cutting down trees, crops by planting, meat by killing wild creatures, etc. You can also use the Disassemble Bench in the territory to decompose scrap and turn it into raw materials or craft low-level materials into high-level materials through the furnace in the territory. These resources can be used to create necessary items for players.
- Armbench: use the collected resources to forge or upgrade weapons.
- Equipment bench:  use the collected resources to build or upgrade equipment.
- Workbench: use the collected resources to build/repair vehicles or make tools, ammunition, etc.
- Stove: use the collected resources to cook food to ensure survival.
- Vehicle Modification Bench: modify and change the appearance of vehicles.
Players can improve the level of the territory and the facilities by consuming materials. The higher the level, the more blueprints can be unlocked to make more advanced things.</p>
<p>Cultivation and evolution rules[]
Level[]
Players can gain experience by completing various game tasks and leveling up. A character's level influences the player's ability to enhance their territory technology, as well as their capacity to equip stronger gear and wield more powerful weapons.</p>
<p>Memetic[]
The memetic system allows players to explore various abilities within the game, such as survival and manufacturing-related skills. Players can choose from three paths: "Collector, Survivalist, Engineer, " each representing a different ability. Subsequently, players can earn points by leveling up, and each point can unlock a Memetic. Once all the Memetics are unlocked, players will receive the master Memetic, which grants them enhanced abilities.
↵For example：Hoarder Memetic - Expands 10 slots in the Backpack for scraps.</p>
<p>Cradle[]
The Cradle system can provide players with active skills. Having active skills enhances players' combat abilities. As levels increase, more skills will be unlocked. Players can choose any two skills to use together.
↵For example：Blaze Explosion - Lob a fireball in the aimed direction, and the explosion deals significant blaze damage.</p>
<p>Character survival rules, diet, drinking water, health, and other status descriptions[]
In the game, players have five status values: sanity, health, hydration, energy level, and oxygen.↵There are Stardust-contaminated environments and aberrant monsters throughout the game.
↵Players will lose their sanity upon entering such a polluted environment or being attacked by aberrations. A decrease in sanity will lower the upper limit of health. If sanity drops to a certain level, players may not even see food. It is possible to restore sanity by taking medicine.
↵When players are attacked by creatures, fall from a great height, get poisoned, or drown, their health value will decrease. Once health reaches zero, players will die. Health can be restored using activators.
↵Hydration and energy levels decrease over time. When they drop to zero, players will enter a state of water shortage and starvation. In the water shortage state, players cannot sprint. In starvation, players can not automatically recover health over time. Eating food and drinking beverages will resolve the issue.
↵When players are diving, their oxygen supply decreases. When it drops to zero, players will enter a state of suffocation, causing health to continuously decrease. This state can be recovered after leaving the water.</p>
<p>Map Introduction[]
The stage where the game takes place is a virtual island city called Nalcott. Before the disaster, it was a comprehensive city integrating scientific research, energy and tourism. Rosetta and other organizations have been existed here for many years. Nalcott is divided into 4 areas, namely the Blackfell in the east, the Arkam-Region in the north, the Great Plains in the west, and the downtown of Nalcott in the center. The entire game map is 16km*16km, so players can fully explore and enjoy the game.
The Blackfell is dominated by Gobi wasteland and swamps, which have the most abundant mineral resources but a lack of water resouces. Sandstorms often blow up here, causing damage to the player's territorial buildings.
The Arkam Mountains in the north are covered with snow all year round. The temperature is low, and people lack food. But there are many unknown bunkers and shelters, where players can get a lot of ammunition and weapon supplies. The snowstorms in Arkhm Mountains are very raging, which could influence the energy level and hydration of players.
the Great Plains in the east used to be a tourist attraction, with flat terrain and many beautiful scenic buildings as well as subway lines extending in all directions.But now it is  occupied by Vultures and aberrations. So players need to be careful about their attacks when exploring supplies.
The downtown of Nalcott in the center used to be the most prosperous urban area and it was also the core area of ​​Rosetta. But now it is the most polluted area by Stardust. Players cannot directly reach it unless they complete the preliminary tasks. </p>
