Characteristics[]
The Eclipse Bear prepares for hibernation by consuming large amounts of food and accumulating fat stores. Unfortunately, this also means ingesting a significant quantity of Stardust, which eats away at the Eclipse Bear’s flesh while it sleeps. By spring, very little of the animal typically remains—perhaps just a single ear or a few scraps of fur—marking the completion of its mutation into the Corrupted Bear.

Behavior[]
Corrupted Bears are usually found roaming alone, though they are occasionally spotted in small groups. The accumulation of Stardust in their bodies shortens their lifespans and increases their aggression.

Strategy[]
Focus your attacks on their head to maximize damage.
