Summary[]
Securement Silo - THETA is a high-level dungeon.
For a chance to capture Enchanting Void solve the "mirror statues" puzzle and defeat the elite Deviant that appears.

Deviation Archive[]
This dark, damp, underground waterway has become a breeding ground for Deviants, and sinister black water has permeated the area.
Get in there and clear out the Deviation before Rosetta's troops arrive.

Tips[]
Avoid, as much as possible, standing in the black water as it consumes Sanity.
Having the Bounce stat effect on a weapon will greatly help in the final boss fight as Saint El continiously spawns enemies around himself.
