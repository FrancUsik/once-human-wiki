Yes, Joss Cooper made a trip to Holt Town last night to pay a visit to pay a visit to old Beverly. The news is true, but I don't know how he was greeted by the Holt Family. It was the first official meeting between the two families in years. It's been so long since they fell out during the oil crisis.
We heard the Joss, or maybe his daughter, will be leaving next month to go up to meet Ted Holt. His Blackfell Oil and Gas company is still hanging on, so if he can lend a hand, maybe the Burnses still have a chance to survive
