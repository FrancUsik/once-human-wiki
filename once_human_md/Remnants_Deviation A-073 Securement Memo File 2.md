Deviation A-073 Securement Memo File 2[]
Security Level: Top-Secret
Level 2 Researcher: Fortyone I-S0641
Note: An intact Cradle was recovered near Subject A-073 with a design and manufacture consistent with those used by the Mayflies. Energy stored within the Cradle shows unusual signs of activity, and seems to become more volatile when near Subject A-073. The Cradle has been placed in a separate room for safekeeping until more research can be conducted.
