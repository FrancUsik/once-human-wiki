# Remnants/Before the Endgame

Before the Endgame[]
Klein Warren, Hunter Captain
Tall Grass Inn, East Chalk Peak
May 20, ▮▮35
Everything is ready, several members of the team are battle-hardened and experienced hunters. And with the addition of Mayfly Anne Shaw, that "Silent Beast" is certain to be ours. Still, Maxie is worried... I can't remember how many times she has mentioned that she wants to come with us. While her medical knowledge is useful, the presence of my wife on the battlefield would certainly be a distraction, and so I have always insisted that she stays at Tall Grass to take care of the aftermath (victory is certain, but so are injuries) and, of course, the preparations for the celebratory feast.
We will set out at dawn, leaving in silence and returning to cheers that rise up to the sky.
