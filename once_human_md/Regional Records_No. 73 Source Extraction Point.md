# Regional Records/No. 73 Source Extraction Point

No. 73 Source Extraction Point[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
No. 73 Source Extraction Point isn't the typical ravaged ruin. In fact, it looks even more secure and complete than it did before the Starfall, as if the turmoil of those years never laid a scratch on it. Rosetta poured massive resources and military force into guarding this fortress with near-fanatical dedication, all because of its research into "Stardust Source Extraction," which is at the very heart of everything that's going on.
From afar, we could see heavily armed Rosetta troops on the walls through our binoculars, their sealed tactical armor reflecting cold light from within their visors. They aren't just keeping intruders out - they're making sure nothing escapes from inside.
Very little is known about the experiments Rosetta is conducting here. But one thing is clear - they aren't just extracting energy. They are trying to dissect the very nature of stardust itself, attempting to isolate some unknown primal essence from its pollutants and mutagenic agents.
