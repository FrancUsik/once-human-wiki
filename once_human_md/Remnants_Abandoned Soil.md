# Remnants/Abandoned Soil

Abandoned Soil[]
White King, the Priest
Rotten Saddle, South Chalk Peak
March 27, ▮▮28
Today, we abandon this once-blessed old city and set out to find the utopia revealed to us by Stardust in a dream.
This utopia is waiting for us deep within a cave, up in the mountains. We leave this place to the Lost, in the hope that one day, by the grace of Stardust, humanity will prosper and return once again.
