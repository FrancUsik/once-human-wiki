Mom and Dad say this weird blue corn is just a new variety. But if that's the case, why didn't they mention it back in planting season? And it doesn't taste right. No matter how much you ear, it never seems to fill you up. I feel like I'm constantly hungry these days, even right after finishing a meal. I need a second opinion. I wonder if Bonnie and Emma have been growing these blue crops too? Tomorrow, I think I'll pay them a visit, bring them some of our blue corn, and see if I can find out more.
