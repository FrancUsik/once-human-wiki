# Weapons

Weapons serve as the main means of combat, and come in several major types, such as Pistol, Assault Rifle, Light Machine Gun, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Submachine Gun, Crossbow, Heavy Weapon, and Melee Weapon. Each type offers unique benefits. Most Weapons can be Crafted with Weapon Blueprints at the Weapons Workbench. Weapon Blueprints can be obtained through exploring Strongholds, buying from merchants, and more.

Upgrade Mechanics[]
Each individual weapon has independent stats which can be upgraded by various means. 

Enhancement[]
The amount of "stars" your item has is it's enhancement level. You can only use Weapon Blueprint Fragments of the same style (Huntsman, Wanderer, Operator, Juggernaut, Beyonder, Stranger) to upgrade each other. Common items can only reach a max enhancement of 3 while Legendary items can reach a max enhancement of 6. Enhancement generally increases the DMG stat of your weapon across all tiers. This increase is not retroactive, and you will have to craft a new weapon to benefit from it.

Weapon Blueprint Fragment Experience Values[]
The rarity of the blueprint fragment determines how much XP it is worth, a matching fragment gets a x2 XP bonus.

Tier Level[]

Weapons tier level determines what materials are used to craft them and their overall stats and level requirement, ranking from tier I - tier V (1-5). 
Each Tier unlocks at each tenth level.

Calibration[]

Most Weapons are not fine-tuned when they are crafted. Weapon Calibration can improve various aspects of Weapons' performance. You can perform Weapon Calibration at the Weapons Workbench. Higher-tier Weapons allow more Calibration chances.

Calibration Blueprints[]

Repairing Weapons[]

The Durability of a Weapon will decrease as you use the weapon or upon death. A Weapon will become unusable when its Durability drops to 0. You can use certain materials to repair Weapons at the Weapons Workbench or with an All-Purpose Hand. (Only weapons that you have crafted can be repaired)

Ammo[]

Ammo's DMG varies according to different materials. Crafting more powerful bullets becomes increasingly difficult. Ammo can be crafted at the Supplies Workbench, with the more advanced Ammo types requiring the use of the Advanced Supplies Workbench and Advanced Ammo Formulas (Unlocked in the memetics menu.) Ammo for explosive weapons, such as the RPG or Grenade Launcher, can be made at a Synthesis Bench.


Accessories[]

For primary and secondary weapons, you can apply several categories of accessory (Muzzle, Optic, Tactic, Magazine and Ammo). Each accessory affects weapon stats such as Stability, Accuracy, Range and Reload Speed. Some magazines also affect the ammo capacity of your weapon.
