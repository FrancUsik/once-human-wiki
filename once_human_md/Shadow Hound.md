The Rabizex Great One resides in an Almit-class Rift Space within Monolith BL7298X.
This Rife Space was activated in [REDACTED] using a Stardust equivalent of approximately [REDACTED] units. Conditions inside the Rift Space are extremely chaotic, with personnel requiring multiple [REDACTED] to successfully cross the Rift and enter the Great One's domain. Upon entry, personnel are subjected to a powerful and persistent [REDACTED], resulting in an inability to coherently describe the Great One in their reports.
Medical examinations of survivors revealed that the Rabizex Great One inflicted not only lacerations but also peculiar [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] caused by some unknown material.

Morphological changes[]
When its health value drops to a certain level, the Shadow Hound will enter a violent state, and its Noumenon will come out from the shell of the head. At this time, its attack power and skill power will be greatly improved, but the damage its head receives is also increased accordingly.

Weak point[]
Parts of the body that are exposed outside the shadow shell, such as the split in the shoulders, and the head when entering violent stage.
