This place sucks, there's nothing here but empty bottles! Why am I stuck in this shit-hole, while the rest can all go west? The life of a Marauder is freedom--that was bullshit! Instead I have to listen to the bosses, put up with their complaints, do what they say... and if I Don't I'll be shot in the head and left for the vultures. Real vultures, I mean.
There seems to be a restaurant on the west side, maybe I'll find something there. They better bring my back my share when they return... Dammit, why did I agree to stay here?
