I get it, Vanessa's the real deal. Though and quick on her feet, she is the perfect leader we need to fight against Rosetta. But do you know how fast our gang's been shrinking lately?
We can't fight two battles at once. A new gang rolled into Sandbank in cars... Cars! Can you believe that? I think they're called the Union? They've likely been colluding with Simon Meyer's people for a while, and now they're here to support them with weapons and equipment.
And then there's Roseetta. We caught 'em off guard a few times before, but let's not forget how dangerous they are, alright? I mean, they're the one who caused the apocalypse, and now they're back. How the hell did that happen?
Look, man, you're a hotshot to Vanessa, and she'd listen to you. I met someone not long ago from Chalk Peak in the west who claims to be some sort of a "heavenly messenger." Might sound all hocus-pocus, but I think it's work introducing him to Vanessa...
