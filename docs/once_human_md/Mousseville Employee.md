Characteristics[]
The stunning Onyx Tundra was the crown of the north, and Mousseville its most precious jewel-until the Starfall destroyed everything. These pastry chefs once used their hands to combine sugar, cream, and peaches into cakes, but now extend them towards the throats of the innocent.

Behavior[]
Mousseville Employee's are incredibly skittish, not only noticable by their white work attire, hats, and blue gloves and mask, but by their involuntary and aggressive twitchy body movements. When attacking the player they will sometimes attempt sneak attacks, speeding up and lunging towards them.

Strategy[]
Aim for the head, as this is the Mousseville Employee's weakspot, doing increased damage.

Locations[]
Mousseville Employee's can be found in Mousse City.

Drops[]
Mousseville Employee's have a chance of dropping:

Acid
Junk
