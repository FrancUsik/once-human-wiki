# Remnants/Bid Farewell to the Past

Bid Farewell to the Past[]
Henry Giles, Mayor
Mining Town, West Chalk Peak
November 10, ▮▮17
We were once a flourishing mining town. We produced the finest construction stone on Nalcott Island, supplying Blackfell Oil and Gas, West Star City, and all the major players in the northern mountains. I'm proud of our past... but now, it's time to look to the future. I've agreed to Rosetta's acquisition proposal for the town's public land, including the old mine and the stone processing plant. So get ready for some big changes around here. I've seen the plans. Rosetta are going to bulldoze all those old houses down in the valley and put up a "Monolith." That's right - the cutting-edge energy facility you've been hearing so much about.
It's time to let go of the past and embrace change. Trust me. When we look back, we'll see, this was the best thing to ever happen to our little mining town.
