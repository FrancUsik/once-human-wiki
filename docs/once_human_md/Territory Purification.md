To start Territory Purification, you need to build a Stardust Resonant Filter - go into the Build menu, Facilities -  4th tab, Function Facility.
It's highly recommended to build defenses around the Resonant Filter, as the enemies will run towards it to damage it.
If you are on a PvP Server, your territory will enter the Chaotic State, allowing the other players to attack it.
