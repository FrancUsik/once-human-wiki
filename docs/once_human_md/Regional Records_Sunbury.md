Regional Records/Sunbury[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
The original inhabitants of this town perished in the Starfall. Like Sunbury Middle School to the east, the town has now been occupied bandits. A LOT of bandits.
But things are more complicated than that. Rosetta has also established several outposts to the west. Things tend to play out in a similar way to how they do up north - with lots of threats and saber-rattling. Violent incidents tend to be short and end in retreat.
Of course, hostilities between Rosetta and the bandits are good for Sandbank (the bandits act as a buffer between the residents and Rosetta). The bandits have nailed a bloodstained Rosetta uniform to a post right next to the main Sunbury entrance. There are also a couple of not-so-intact corpses dangling from streetlights. The bandits don't intend to go down without a fight - that much is clear.
We, the expedition team, don't plan on getting ourselves caught up in all this mess. We did some careful recon of the surrounding area, then avoided Sunbury by crossing the hilly terrain to the north.
