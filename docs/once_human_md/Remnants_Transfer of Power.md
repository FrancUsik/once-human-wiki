Quiet down, everyone, please.
We admit that we have made mistakes and poor decision in the past, but all is clear now. The White King and Black King are the true rulers of this world and the chosen savior of Stardust. We... formally relinquish all authority of this entire sanctuary to them. Henceforth, their decisions will dictate the fate of everyone here and whether we can survive.
The committee is hereby dissolved. That is all.
