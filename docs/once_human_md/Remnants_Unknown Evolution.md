Unknown Evolution[]

Since I came to this wreck of a town, I lost count of how many strange things have happened. The meat I was curing in a barrel disappeared just the other day as if plucked out by a ghost.
But what was even weirder, was seeing a flying woman (I'm sure it was a woman, my eyesight's good enough to see those curves) make a helicopter explode with the mere movement of her hands. Women, helicopter, and birds, aren't the only thing in the air, I also saw a huge sea beast wreathed in Stardust, overlook Nalcott Island, with wings made out of membrane tissue connecting its head and body. Stardust really seems to have caused some strange paths of evolution...
