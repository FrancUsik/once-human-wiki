Summary[]
Blackfell Fallen Zone is located in Red Sands at 4281,-1323.

History[]
Before the Starfall, the Blackfell Fallen Zone formed the industrial outskirts of Blackfell. Rows of factories, warehouses, and workers' dormitories stretched along the oil pipelines, extending deep into the wilderness. Back then, the night sky was illuminated by the flames of refinery towers, and trucks roared day and night, transporting the "black gold." Now, all that remains are charred ruins and wandering Deviants. Thees monsters were once workers, soldiers, or simply poor souls trying to escape the Starfall, but have now become the rotting guardians of this land of death &#91;1&#93;.
