# Remnants/The Only Way

The Only Way[]
Thomas Adamski, Factory Manager
Rippleby, Southeast Iron River
August 2, ▮▮17
Hey man, I know what you mean, but I don't have final say on who gets hired to work in this town's factory. Do you have any skills? Something like being able to repair cars, or lift heavy objects, or use office software well. The factory's received a big contract, and the management is way stricter now. All new hires must be reviewed by Mayor Sutton, and he's no fool.
If you sincerely want to stay in Rippleby, maybe try giving the mayor a sob story and he might agree to let you stay and work here. His troubled son has been away from home for five or six years, so say something like your folks died and you wanted into Rippleby, felt a sense of belonging and want to settle down here.
Don't say I never help you  out, dude. This is the only way I can think of, you'll have to figure out the rest for yourself.
