Caretaker: Are you doing okay? Do you feel comfortable today?
Lady: Oh, don't worry. I'm doing fine. Come, help me try on this new scarf!
Caretaker: You did such a great job. Is this for him?
Lady: Oh, I wouldn't make anything for that old toad. This is for you, dear!
Caretaker: For me?
Lady: You're so good to us, looking after us after everyone else left. I wish I had a daughter like you, you know that?
Caretaker: That's very kind...
Lady: Here, can you help me find the light blue yarn? I think it fell by the trash over there...
Caretaker: Hold on a sec. Ah, I... I found it...
