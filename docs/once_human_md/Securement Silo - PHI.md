Summary[]
Securement Silo - PHI is a mid-level dungeon.

Deviations[]
For a chance to capture Pyro Dino or Chefosaurus Rex, enter into the Seepage Zone by taking the Elevator in the containment room and immediately head left down the hall. Answer the ringing phone to open the door to a padded room, inside the padded room you will phase shift. Immediately kill the elite Rainfall Reaper in the center of the event space and exit through the portal that appears.
After exiting there may be a Deviation spawned (maybe not), you do not need to spend Controllers on the Treasure Chest.

Rewards[]
Shoes Mod
Stardust Source
Energy Links
Armor Mod Parts
Tips[]
In the containment room where you acquire the Rosetta V3 Access Card there is vine wall, behind that wall is a Gear Crate. Use a Molotov Cocktail to burn the vines away and access the crate.
To clear the Seepage Zone you only need to kill the elite Deviant in the middle of the room, you do not need to kill all Deviants.
