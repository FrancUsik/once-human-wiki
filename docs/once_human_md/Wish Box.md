The Wish Box is a territory deviation. When placed inside of an isolated securement unit in the player's territory, it will be able to transform items into a random item.

Deviation Skill[]
Unfair Trade: Transform items placed in the Wish Box into random new items.

Approach the Wish Box and press the interact button 'F' to deposit items inside.
The transformation process starts 5 minutes after items are deposited, during this time players cannot deposit any more items or withdraw items already inside.
At the start of each real-life hour, the Wish Box transforms the items placed inside it into random new items.
You can claim the transformed items at the Wish Box's isolated securement unit.

Story[]
"Deviation O-060 is a one-of-a-kind "Morphic - Crate" entity. Its basic physiological traits are identical to the standard specimen, though it is slightly larger than average. The Deviation is docile, lively, and highly interactive, with no signs of aggression. Its intelligence is comparable to that of a 2- to 4-year-old dog.
(Handwritten note: "So cute, I want to mark it somehow." - Researcher ■■■)
O-060's main Deviation Trait is its material reconstruction ability. When an object of suitable size is placed inside O-060's "box," it will close its "lid" and enter a low-activity state, becoming unresponsive to external stimuli. Approximately 40-60 minutes later, the "lid" reopens, and the object is transformed into something else. The reconstructed output generally aligns with the expectations or intent of the person who placed the original object, often including materials that weren't part of the input. No measurable exchange of matter or energy occurs during the process, and the source of the additional material remains unknown. All attempts to observe O-060 during the reconstruction phase have failed.
It's worth noting that since it was secured on ■■■/■■/■■, O-060's mass has increased by 19%, and its dimensions have expanded by 8%.
Experiment Log O-060-A-■■Personnel: Researcher
Input: 400 grams of wheat flour.Output: A 14-inch Neapolitan pizza, described by Site Director ■■■ as exceptionally authentic.
Input: 1.2 kilograms of iron ore.Output: An 800mm-long logging axe, well-balanced and comfortable to handle.
Input: A white rat.Output: A white rabbit, with fur painted in purple and bright yellow water-based colors.
Input: Test subject D-163, a small "Morphic - Crate" entity, 41 cm in size and weighing 50 kg.Output: An Anima entity, designated O-060-A-1, which possesses the same Deviation Trait as O-060. It is now secured alongside O-060 in the same securement chamber.
Researcher ■■ was reprimanded and demoted to V3 clearance for conducting unauthorized biological interaction experiments.

Trivia[]
If players insert items into the Wish Box just before the next hour the Wish Box will still transform them. Note: The Wish Box needs 5 minutes to lock in the item(s) for transformation, therefore any items inserted past the 55th minute into the hour will not finish transforming by the next hour.
