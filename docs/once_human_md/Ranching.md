Players can have a maximum of 6 animals in their territory, and can either slaughter them for their products, or keep them as tamed beasts to help protect the player's territory. This page covers a wide range of information about ranching, including: Capturable Animals, How to Capture Animals, Feeding Animals, Taming Animals, Animal Products and Byproducts, Breeding Animals, Related Memetics, and Related Tools.

In order to capture an animal players must first subdue the animals. This is done by using either a Tranquilizer Throwing Needle or Tranquilizer Arrow, unlocked from the Animal Capture node in the Logistics section of the Memetics page, this costs  7body[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .meme-points-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)} and  2,000body[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .energy-links-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)}.

Animals that can be captured are found in the wilderness with a white-lined indicator near the halfway point of their health bar. To use a tranquilizer tool players must first deplete the animal's health below the white-lined indicator, causing the indicator to turn blue when it has been depleted enough. Throwing a single tranquilizer throwing needle, or shooting a single tranquilizer arrow will be enough to subdue, and capture the animal. The animal will then be found in the 'tools' section in the player's backpack.
If a player is high level and attempting to capture a low level animal it is important that they do not use any weapons that may immediately kill the animal. Instead player's often opt for melee attacks with an unarmed strike or a Chainsaw.
Tip 1: When attempting to capture animals players can use Spectral Canned Mushroom, causing the animal to become stunned and easier to capture.Tip 2: Animals in the wild can spawn with rare patterns.

Animal Tiers[]
When capturing animals they will have a tier ranging from S to C. These tiers will determine the number of traits the animals have. Players can only identify which tier of animal they have once it has been captured.
S Tier animals will have 4 traits, unlocked after they have reached level 20, 50, and then two at 80.A Tier animals will have 3 traits, unlocked after they have reached level 20, 50, and then 80.B Tier animals will have 2 traits, unlocked after they have reached level 20, and then 50.C Tier animals will have 1 trait, unlocked after they have reached level 20 tameness.
For a list of the different traits animals can have click here.

Feeding Animals[]
Animal's need to be given the correct food, and water, in order to thrive at the player's territory and, depending on which animal has been captured, produce byproducts or defend the player's territory. To see what an animals diet is players can look at the animal's details, by hovering over the animal in the player's inventory and pressing 'shift', or by placing them down in the territory and pressing 'F'.
Primarily, animals will drink Dirty Water, Boiled Water, and Purified Water; and eat a diet of either meat, grains, or herbs. Food can be discarded from the players inventory onto the floor for the animals to eat, but can also be placed inside animal troughs, note that once food is placed inside the trough it will no longer decay, but the player will not be able to withdraw the food back into their inventory.

Favorite Foods[]
In addition to an animals regular diet, they can have favorite foods. Favorite foods are food items that captured animals particularly enjoy, helping to increase tameness quicker than just keeping their hunger and hydration levels above 30%. Every time a captured animal eats one of their favorite foods their tameness will increase by 1%.

Animal Feed[]
Feeding captured animals with their standard diet foods such as regular fruits, meats, herbs, and grains will allow them to eat several within a short period of time to fill their hunger meters, however, the most efficient way to keep animals well fed is to convert meat, grains, or herbs into their feeds at an Electric Stove or Kitchen Set, keeping them fuller for longer:

Meat Pellet Feed
Grain Concentrate Feed
Herbal Green Feed
Additionally, there are other types of feed that have their own effects:

Body Enhancement Feed I - Used to enhance an animals physical functions and raise all it's attributes to level 20.
Body Enhancement Feed II - Used to enhance an animals physical functions and raise all it's attributes to level 30.
Body Enhancement Feed III - Used to enhance an animals physical functions and raise all it's attributes to level 40.
Body Enhancement Feed IV - Used to enhance an animals physical functions and raise all it's attributes to level 50.
Tip: Animals will need to be fed regularly, so it is usually more efficient for the player to have the corresponding Deviations on their territory to help collect the food required:

Lethal Rabbit: Meat
Hydronaut Fish: Fish
Fetch-A-Lot Bunny: Herbs, Grains, Fruits, Vegetables.
Taming Animals[]
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			Tameness: 31% 		 	 
At first, captured animals will have 0% tameness. The player can increase tameness by keeping the animal's hydration and hunger meter above 30%, or by feeding the animal their favorite foods. Tameness will decrease over time if the animal's hydration or hunger reaches 0%.

Animal Products and Byproducts[]
After capturing and taming certain animals, players can opt to slaughter the animals, or collect byproducts. Animals will only start to produce byproducts when their tameness reaches 50% and above, this is also the threshold needed to be able to actually harvest the byproducts from the animal. The percentage will affect an animals behavior, traits, and the yield of their byproducts.
If players opt to slaughter their tamed animals, the animal's traits will determine the amount and rarity of products collected.

Slaughtering Tamed Animals[]
Slaughtering tamed animals gives the player a chance to receive the animal's Provided products. Usually these contain: Meats, Furs, Hides, and Wools, of differing rarities, and a chance at obtaining Pristine Meat.

Obtaining Byproducts[]

Animal byproducts can only be obtained from certain variants of animals, these are listed below. There are various types of animal byproducts that can be obtained through animal ranching. These include Wools and Milk, from female variants. Animals will only start to produce byproducts when their tameness reaches 50% and above, this is also the threshold needed to be able to actually harvest the byproducts from the animal.

Breeding and Younglins[]
Breeding Conditions[]
For animals to breed the player needs to meet the following conditions:

The territory has a Youngling Hut built
Animals are at a tameness between 80%-100%.
Additionally, each tier has a different amount of "breeding chances", equating to how many times that animal can have an offspring. Breeding chances ranges from 5 to 7:S Tier: 7 Breeding Chances.A Tier: 6 Breeding Chances.B Tier: 6 Breeding Chances.C Tier: 5 Breeding Chances.

Polar Bears can not mate with normal Bears.
Snow Foxes can not mate with normal Foxes.
Younglins become fully matured within 24 real-life hours.
Younglins[]
Players can obtain animals of a certain tier through breeding. Animals of the same tier breeding together have a higher chance to produce a younglin of that same tier. Younglings will inherit or improve upon their parents' ratings, traits and appeareances (younglins are guaranteed a trait if both parents have a shared trait). Furthermore, parents with rare patterns give their youngling(s) a higher likelihood of inheriting a rare pattern.

Captured animals and younglins can be transferred from scenario to scenario, granted the player has enough Material Points.
The limit to how many animals can be placed in Eternaland is the same as in a server: 6.
