You are the survivalist in the wilderness[]
Most of the land, under the pollution of Stardust, has become a wild area that is difficult to be used by human beings, and is spread all over the teratogens and dangerous creatures. In such a harsh environment, the surveyors must be 100 times careful to obtain available materials from polluted water and soil and survive for a minute and a second.

You are the soldier fighting against the catastrophe[]
The Stardust catastrophe has spawned countless monsters, which have occupied almost the whole world. We must recover the homeland of mankind from them! Although the metamorphosis has always regarded humans as prey, now, transcendent, we have you... It's time for you to become a hunter.

You are the builder of civilization[]
Yes, brick by brick, from a house to a town, and finally, the civilized society of mankind. Thirty years of grief almost annihilated the remaining human memory of the past, but you still remember. You should tell the latecomers about the prosperity and lead them to recreate it.

You are the transcendent of human evolution[]
What is the truth of the catastrophe? Is there any secret to completely curing dust pollution in the mysterious Rosetta base? To know this, relying on one person's strength is not enough. You need to gather all those who share the same ideals - transcendent and ordinary human beings - to explore the mysteries of destruction and evolution.

↵Players will lose their sanity upon entering such a polluted environment or being attacked by aberrations. A decrease in sanity will lower the upper limit of health. If sanity drops to a certain level, players may not even see food. It is possible to restore sanity by taking medicine.
↵When players are attacked by creatures, fall from a great height, get poisoned, or drown, their health value will decrease. Once health reaches zero, players will die. Health can be restored using activators.
↵Hydration and energy levels decrease over time. When they drop to zero, players will enter a state of water shortage and starvation. In the water shortage state, players cannot sprint. In starvation, players can not automatically recover health over time. Eating food and drinking beverages will resolve the issue.
↵When players are diving, their oxygen supply decreases. When it drops to zero, players will enter a state of suffocation, causing health to continuously decrease. This state can be recovered after leaving the water.
