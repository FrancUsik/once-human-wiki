Summary[]
Rotten Saddle is located in Chalk Peak at 1720,-5906.

History[]
Rotten Saddle is the origin of the Vultures.
The Vultures were active here in the early days under the guise of prophets, healers, and philosophers. It also allowed the leaders to recruit their first followers, who were also the earliest members of the gang. They gradually corrupted more residents until the entire sanctuary fell, and all the righteous people who refused to abandon their consciences were killed.
The remaining members turned this place into a bandit lair, until they left too &#91;1&#93;.
