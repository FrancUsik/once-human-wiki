There's nothing of value left in this place, except for some moldy old planks, and a bunch of rusted tools. It sure is dangerous though - mutated creatures lurking round every corner. Ron was ripped to shreds by a two-mouthed shark last week while crossing the sea. All his supplies, and the raft, are now sitting at the bottom of the ocean. Theresa won't hear a word of it, but we're running out of things to scavenge. And the risk of heading back to shore just keeps going up. We can't keep living this way. I've been putting it off for too long... Now's the time to head inland and find out once and for all if we're the only ones left in this world.
