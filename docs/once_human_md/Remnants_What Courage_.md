What Courage?[]

Inna was angry tonight for no apparent reason. She kept on sobbing and wouldn't let me even touch her. I have no idea why. She keeps asking me to "show courage," but what does it take for me to show courage? Wasn't it enough to disobey the Matriarchs and stay with her
I finally snapped at her. Even though I immediately realized I had lost control and apologized, she left without looking back. Really... I'll have to find a chance to apologize, but I should let her calm down first.
