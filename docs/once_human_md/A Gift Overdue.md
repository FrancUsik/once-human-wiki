Clues[]
Clue 1[]
Hey, Annie, did you notice the reminder? The first digit is 5! 
Your challenge, should you choose to accept it - Collect the 4 digit code and unlock the loot crate! The other 3 digits can be found in a place where you work up a sweat, on the stairs below the window, and in a place where you can read, but not for free...
Once you've found them all, look behind the little red shelter opposite the restaurant. Your treasure is right there!

Clue 2 (Pool)[]
Say, do you ever get tired when you're here, working up a sweat? This place closes on Fridays after 9PM. The third clue!

Clue 3 (Stairs below the window)[]
Do you remember that lecture series? The one about detective stories? I don't think there's been once since July... The final clue!

Clue 4 (A place you can read)[]
Well, that was easy... the second digit of the password is 8.

Liz' Letter[]
Congratulations, Annie! You solved my little riddle!
Glad you're playing this game too... You're enjoying it, right? All my puzzles have to do with our friendship. Reading together, talking about anything and everything... I miss that. Lately, I've not been with you much. But it's not because I don't want to be your friend anymore. It's just that... because of my parents' jobs, I need to leave this place. 
Hey, Annie, did you find the book? I can't be with you right now, so I hope it can keep you company instead. I remember you saying this was your favorite author. 
Your friend forever, Lily
