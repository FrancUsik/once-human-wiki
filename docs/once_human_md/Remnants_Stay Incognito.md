Chester made breakfast today. I like roasted rabbit, but six rabbits for two people seemed a bit excessive. Chester insisted on taking the two mutated ones for himself. It was a nice gesture, but that Stardusty tang you get with mutated meat doesn't really bother me anymore. And besides, I can maintain my sanity better than he can.
In the afternoon, we'll continue eastward. Sandbank seems worth checking out, but I don't want to stay there permanently. It's too close to our old home, and we might be recognized by someone we should be avoiding. Denise says that we should head for Blackfell or Camp Forward. It'll be easier for us to hide in one of the more distant refuges...
