Mayor Sutton's no-good son has returned to Rippleby. Actually, he's not no-good. It turns out he's Dr. (I think) Thomas Sutton, a geographic researcher who traveled to Nalcott Island.
As soon as he returned, though, he went against his father's wishes and told us we should reject Rosetta's deal. We are not fools here. We know a good opportunity to make money when we see it, and Rosetta is flush. Not to mention that we have already been working with Rosetta for nearly a year, and even the fishing port has been directly transferred to them. Plus, there is no bigger or better factory nearby, and we can raise prices however we want.
Thomas also said that Rosetta's engineering project would endanger all mankind. Such alarmism is really beyond belief. The cooperation between Rippleby and Rosetta is so close that even when the Brewster family in the north wanted to get involved, Rosetta turned them down. As long as the unit price for Rosetta's contract is raised, and a batch of raw materials is produced for a low price, I figure about 40% of the price difference will go straight to me.
