Description[]
Stardust Source is a semi-rare resource that players can obtain, with several important uses:

Calibrating Weapons and Armor: Its primary purpose is to enhance weapons and armor through the Gear Workbench, allowing players to upgrade their gear and increase damage output—essential for defeating challenging enemies.
Crafting Quick Activators: A vital item for survival, especially in high-risk areas.
Crafting Adrenaline Shots: Another key survival item that helps players stay alive during dangerous encounters.
This makes Stardust Source an essential resource for both offense and survival.&#91;1&#93;

How To Get[]
Rift Anchors[]
Rift Anchors are marked on the map and grant rewards, including Stardust Source, when activated. They also provide access to Monoliths.

Rosetta Facilities[]
Rosetta Facilities require an Access Card (found in Stronghold supply crates) to activate. Players must defend these facilities against waves of enemies to earn Stardust Source, Acid, and Mixed Fuel. There are many facilities known as Securement Silos which are dungeon-like areas where players must defeat a boss and enemies to claim Stardust Source and other rewards.

Buy from Merchants[]
Stardust Source can be purchased from merchants like Nisa at Meyer's Market for 6 Sproulets, which are earned via events like Cargo Scramble and Highway Pursuit.

Craft via Electric Furnace[]
Stardust Source can be crafted using Stardust Ores and Portable Mixed Fuel. The recipe is unlocked through Oil Processing Memetic in Memetic Specialization.

Open Mystical Crates[]
Mystical Crates, found at Rift Anchors and other key locations, contain Stardust Source, weapon blueprints, and gear.

Open Morphic Crates[]
Morphic-Crates, invisible crates found around the map by snapping your fingers when the locator on the backpack starts flashing.  Morphic-Crates in higher area's give more Stardust Source

Progress the Battle Pass[]
Stardust Source is available as a reward at specific tiers of the Battle Pass, which is leveled up by completing in-game tasks.&#91;1&#93;
