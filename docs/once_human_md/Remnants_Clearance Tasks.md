Wade II-S6310, Security Squad Member
Saddlefront Camp, South Chalk Peak
September 13, ▮▮32
There was no a single trace of ▮▮▮ left, and ▮▮▮ and ▮▮▮ were even harder to find. Everyone's spirits are on the brink, and an hour more will leave us dancing on the precipice of total insanity. Those Deviants, they're just too weird.
They look almost like regular people. But they're not 100% human. They're only about a meter tall, but with the proportions of normal adults. They kind of started... swarming? Late at night. Now, I think I know why a pristine camp like this was left undefended. It wasn't abandoned, it was left like this deliberately, as a trap!
Where the hell is our backup? Our ammo is running out, and those little people just keep coming! How are there so many of them? Did they star breeding after Starfall? Shit, now's not the time for that. Open fire! Come on, fire!
