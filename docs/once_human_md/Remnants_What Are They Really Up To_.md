What Are They Really Up To?[]
Kaitilin March, Mayfly
Brookham, North Dayton Wetlands
August 4, ▮▮36
This town is marked on old maps as Brookham. It was once the largest town and most important transportation hub in this area. Of course, that was before the "Silver Gate" connected to the Starfall Monolith and destroyed the town.
So, why did Rosetta build a Monolith so close to a densely populated area? There were many obvious practical benefits - easy access to supplies, better for transporting construction materials, and so on. But they had another, deeper motive. They wanted to turn the town into an observation site, a place where they could observe the effects of the Monolith launch on the local population.
That was all 10 yeas ago no, and that Monolith has long since been abandoned, but the concentration of Stardust particles is still very high in this area. How long will it take before the great river of time can wash away the stain of Stardust, and purify this land...?
