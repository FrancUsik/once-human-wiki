# Buffs and Effects

Buffs and Effects are status' that appear on a player either indefinitely, or for a limited time. They can be obtained through various means, such as eating Food items, using Consumables, or using Furniture. Although sometimes interchangeable, in Once Human Buffs refer to positive effects that are only active for a limited time, and Effects refers to both positive effects that are instantaneous, and negative effects.
