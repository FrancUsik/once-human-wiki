Calling All Criminals - Surrender![]
Jim Chandler, Sheriff
Sunbury, South Broken Delta

Attention! All passers-by are requested to read this notice carefully!
First things first. Let me introduce myself. I'm Jim Chandler, the Union's newly appointed Guard Captain for the town of Sandbank. That means it's my job to bring some semblance of law and order to this place.
And, just as luck would have it, robbery, arson, pillage and murder are popular pasties in this town. You have been warned. I hereby call upon all law-breakers across Sandbank to do the right think and tun ourselves in. As Guard Captain, I assure you that the Union has a just and formalized judicial process in place. All cries will be investigated and tried in the fairest possible manner.
Of course, I understand that not everyone will heed my advice. I also understand that there are people in this ton who wear their brutality, their viciousness, their venom, their inhumanity with pride! Yes! I've heard of your deeds. And I know the names of your victims. Sarah Buckley, Toby Mann, Jun Yeol Kim, Noah Strong... the list goes on.
Do you even remember their names? Well, now I'm here to avenge them.
