Amanda's been going round saying that a flying woman took down the helicopter. I call bullshit on that.
I'm just pissed that the berets berets to the wreckage. Picked it clean before we could even get there. The next morning, when they finally cleared out, we found that they'd even taken the pilot. All we managed to pick up was some ammo, a couple weapon accessories, and some kind of... robot? It can't be that useful, or the berets would've taken it, but whatever. Jordan Donahue knows a thing or two about mechanics, maybe he can strip it down for parts.
