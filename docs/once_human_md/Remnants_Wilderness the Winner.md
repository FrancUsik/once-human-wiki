We failed. All of us need to do our parts in order to survive, including the little kids. The desks are empty, and the books were burned as fuel. We're headed down a dangerous path. I can feel it. What kind of people will our children grow up to be if they can't learn? Apathetic drudges? Ruthless hunters? Selfish tyrants? Or ferocious Marauders... In the end, only the wilderness will be their teacher... Only the eternal... wilderness.
