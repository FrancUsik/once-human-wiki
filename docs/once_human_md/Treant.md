head and the woman on back
Location[]
You can fight Treant by heading to the Gaia Cliff Monolith in the Broken Delta during the Murmurs In The Forest quest.
Strategy[]
General Tips[]
Treant will not attack you directly until all 3 Vines around the arena are destroyed. This is a good time to eliminate any extra enemies present in the arena before destroying the final Vine. Multiple Gnawers are present, scattered around the arena.
The left Vine is difficult to reach for close-range combat as the cliff it rests on is steep; the easiest way to get up is by circling around to the southwest corner of the arena and climbing the rocks. Many parts of the cliff can be climbed by jumping repeatedly, but this is not a reliable method.
The right Vine has two Updraft Cannons that can be jumped from for easy access to the broken highway platform. Be aware that there is a lone Watcher guarding this Vine.
Position yourself near Treant's head (always faces the entrance of the arena initially) before destroying the final Vine, if possible, as its head is its weak point.
Once all 3 Vines are destroyed a 120 second damage phase begins. When it expires Treant becomes immune to damage and resets the encounter by summoning the 3 Vines again.
Once the damage phase begins it will create a few Cyst Seeds scattered around the floor of the arena. These are easily broken with a bit of damage and create a safety dome around players that negates most of Treant's attacks.
Long Range[]
Do not drop from the initial platform when entering the boss arena. Use a long-range weapon to shoot down the Vines left, right, and far from your platform. Staying up there, burst down the boss once it becomes vulnerable by targeting the weak point at the head of the Woman.
Most of the boss' attacks are unable to hit the platform.
This is the recommended strategy if you are able to defeat Treant before its vulnerability timer expires.
Medium Range[]
Jump down from the platform and move around the arena, dispatching any random enemy spawns and shooting up at the Vines from below.
Target the left or right Vine last so the boss becomes vulnerable when you're closer to targeting its weak point.
Make ample use of the Cyst Seeds to negate its attacks, you can generally just sit in the radius of the one on the close left after jumping down from the starting platform in the arena and trigger it every time it reappears.
Close Range[]
Use the jump pads on each side of the arena to jump up to the Vines and destroy them at close range.
Once damage begins you can position yourself below Treant's main head and fire up at it or try to melee it.
With fast enough reaction time you can dodge to the left and trigger a Cyst Seed to negate Treant's attacks before going back in for more damage. Staying inside the radius should be close enough for close-range weapons like Shotguns and SMGs to deal effective damage.
This strategy is not recommended as it puts you at significantly greater risk of taking damage and it can be difficult to hit Treant effectively with melee.
