Characteristics[]
When a Customer becomes a Wish Land employee, they are outfitted in a stuffed bear costume, and their latex balloons are replaced with foil animal-face balloons. The Novice Employee Deviant is identifiable by its single balloon, marking it as a newcomer to the workforce.

Behavior[]
Novice Employees have only just learned to use their paintball guns. While seemingly playful, these guns fire pellets at a staggering speed of 700 m/s—more than enough to leave visitors with an “unforgettable” experience.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the animal face balloon. Popping the balloon will temporarily stun the Novice Employee, just keep in mind that they will replace their balloon head if not defeated in a timely manner.

Locations[]
Novice Employees are low-ranking enemies commonly found in the The Way of Winter Scenario.

Drops[]
Novice Employees either drop various scrap materials or Acid.
