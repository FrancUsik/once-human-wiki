Have They Paid us Yet?[]
Oscar Pierre, Union Transportation Manager
Ridge Transfer Station, North Broken Delta
March 21, ▮▮36
Last week Denzel was out transporting fuel when he was attacked by Deviants. In the end, Denzel made it back alive, but it was a close-run thing. I heard Denzel's recounting of the event, and something about it seems suspicious.
The Deviants appeared as if out of nowhere. Denzel's vehicle was equipped with a reconnaissance drone, and both he and Lena sweat on their lives that they kept the drone hovering overhead the whole time while passing through the mountains. No Deviant would be able to get past that drone. But then, suddenly, they found themselves surrounded by Deviants on all sides. It was like those monsters had appeared out of thin air...
This was also the day the Lito kid reported seeing a couple of Rosetta tankers parked east of the Ridge Camp, right? They were parked there until the afternoon, and hen finally drove back to their own base to the est, the drivers looking pretty pissed off about something.
Well, it turns out those Rosetta tankers were stationed only a few miles from where Denzel was attacked.
I know that it was Rosetta who ordered that fuel shipment--but they still haven't paid us yet, have they?
