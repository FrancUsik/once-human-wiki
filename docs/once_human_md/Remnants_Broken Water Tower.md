Damn, Walker is a real bastard. If he hadn't snitched on me to the captain, no way I would have been sent to this crappy water tower! No matter what, I gotta go to the western restaurant and check it out. The only thing in this broken water tower is some blue water. Seems like there's a lot of Stardust here, so I gotta get out of here fast.
But if I come back empty-handed, the captain will definitely ream me out. That idiot Ollie really thinks it's bad luck that he get's to stay behind? At least I can console myself that someone that stupid won't last long as a marauder.
