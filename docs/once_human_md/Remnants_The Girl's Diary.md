The Girl's Diary[]
Dora Burel, Student
Holt Town, East Chalk Peak

It had all been agreed. I wasn't going back to school in the fall. I was gonna get a job in one of the factories and support the family. But then, Mrs. Evans shows up at the house and convinces Dad to let me keep going to school. I don't know how she knew... but I sure am grateful. Studying music is my dream. I dream about taking a boat and leaving Nalcott every night. I wanna go to the mainland, study music, and start a whole new life.
I think I should pay Mrs. Evans a proper visit. Express my gratitude, you know? But I don't have the money to get her a gift. Maybe I could sing her a song instead?
