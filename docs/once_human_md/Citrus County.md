Anonymous Sign Puzzle[]
The scarecrows around the town have been acting weird lately. They keep showing up in strange locations, and we just can't seem to chop them down. But don't worry--they still burn when set on fire.
Remember to pick up your daily can of fuel for your waste incineration need. And if one's not enough, feel free to grab another.
To complete the puzzle, use [F] to pick up a fuel can next to the sign and throw at a deviated scarecrow (the scarecrows holding a lantern).
