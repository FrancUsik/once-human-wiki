Toby Crause, the Union Accountant
Greywater Industrial Zone, Northwest Iron River
February 8, ▮▮37
Hi, I'm Toby Crause, the leader of this operation (pause, look at audience).
Mayor Dennis Mobley's first decision was to establish an industrial zone to protect the military strength and daily life of Greywater (long pause). As his loyal supporters, we will always (emphasize "always") support the mayor's decisions and do our best to build the Greywater industrial zone. We will restart the abandoned oil wells here and expand the functions of the industrial area around these three oil wells to include processing timber, steel, and vehicles.
(Make tone low but powerful to inspire hope) You can all see how much suffering there is in the world. Even though ti's been because since Starfall, the wounds left behind remain unhealed. Greywater was established because of this, to give survivors here hope and purpose. Once (pause) ancient civilization emerged from scattered tribes. Now, a new civilization is bubbling up from Greywater. The mission of reconstruction has fallen on the shoulders of our generation.
Okay, that's it for our mobilization meeting! Please remember to stay safe, report in on time, and always fight for the cause of reconstruction (look at audience)!
