Failed Get Rich Quick Scheme[]
Jason Carey, Local Resident
Dayton Hospital, North Dayton Wetlands
February 19, ▮▮17
When the dust settled on the news that Rosetta was coming here to start some new construction project, I thought the universe was finally giving me my chance to get rich.
God only knows how much money and time I spent to find out before anyone else that a construction project to was due to start over on the Dayton property. Yes, THAT Dayton. The guy who lost all his wealth on bad oil well investments, before throwing himself into the sea with his wife and son. Well, I found the current owner of the Dayton place as soon as I could. I paid a high price for it, too. Every thought I was mad.
But I didn't care, because I was sure that one day, Rosetta would come knocking, wanting to buy the place off me. Turns out, I was the real fool.
Rosetta only wanted to buy as much land as they needed for their project, not an inch more. When I said I'd only sell the whole property, they stonewalled me. Well, after that, I offered to introduce their lawyer goons to my two clenched fists, and got a gun butt to the side of the head for my troubles.
Look, the foundations for that hospital have already been laid down at the bottom of the hill, and further down... That black tower is a already a blot on the beautiful Nalcott skyline, and it's not even finished. And my remaining land has been cordoned off my Rosetta into some kind of Warning Zone. The land, and the oil well, still technically belong to me, but I no longer have the right to set foot on my own property.
