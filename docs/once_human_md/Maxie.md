Field Guide/Personnel Files[]
Mayor of Meyer's Market
Maxie Rodriguez - not that anyone calls her by her full name - is the woman who runs Meyer's Market. She's about 40, and tough as nails. She runs that place with the savagery of a panther defending her cubs.
Rumor has it she as born a bandit and used to kill people when she loved out in the wilderness. Don't every say that to her face, mind you.
Anyway, later on, she was recruited by the Union, and then she worked her way up to become mayor. Not many people know exactly what happened there, and the few who do know won't talk about it.
Anyway, if you've got a useful skill and a good work ethic, go find Maxie. She's a very good employer. But if you're the type who lies, cheats, or steals, then you'd better stay clear of Meyer's Market.
