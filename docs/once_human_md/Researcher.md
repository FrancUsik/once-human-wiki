Characteristics[]
After spending an unimaginable amount of time submerged in the frigid, Stardust-infused ocean before finally reaching land, the Researcher’s exposed skin has become encrusted with immutable Living Ice. This transformation grotesquely distorts their bodies, leaving them as eerie, substandard replicas of the original expedition team.

Behavior[]
The severe physical mutations of Researchers restrict them to primitive physical attacks. Despite enduring damage that would incapacitate a basic Deviant, Researchers remain mobile, held together by the tenacious Living Ice that parasitizes them. To defeat them permanently, they must be exposed to high temperatures or knocked down a second time.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the Researcher’s head. If you can deplete their entire health bar with a single weak spot or critical hit, the Living Ice will not activate, ensuring their immediate defeat. 

Locations[]
Researchers are low-ranking enemies commonly found in the The Way of Winter Scenario.

Drops[]
Researchers either drop various scrap materials or Acid.
