Regional Records/Throughville[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
This is the only place I can be honest. I'm scared to death of venturing into Throughville. I hope I never set even one foot in that place.
God, this place gives me the creeps! There are other settlements closer to the Monolith than this once, and yet, Throughville somehow still manages to be the most terrifying place in the entire Dayton Wetlands. The Stardust lies thick on the ground like some kind of hellish snow, emitting a blue-black glow. And the broken remains of the once living creatures covering every corner of every house... the whole town is one great, twisted nightmare...
I'm afraid we cannot provide any first-hand intel about Throughville. We have, however, down our best to gather relevant information (collected from searching the surrounding areas, interviews already conducted with relevant people, and recollections from myself and others). These are our findings:
Jesse Sutherland was the youngest member of the Sutherland family and the most highly respected among the younger generation. He was the nephew of the patriarch and managed most of the family's resources before the Starfall. He was an overbearing, fearless, and ruthless man, famed for his greed and profligacy. Throughville was a luxury estate and Jesse Sutherland's home before the Starfall. Tightly guarded and well-equipped, the estate was where Jesse stored most of this vast wealth, which he had extracted from the Dayton Wetlands and surrounding areas. No one knows how Jesse Sutherland met his end, because none of Throughville's residents managed to escape with their lives. Looking at the place now, it's not hard to imagine why they all perished. One likely theory:
Jesse Sutherland, along with this guards and a number of close relatives were devoured by Rift Entitles shortly after the Starfall, or else got infected with Stardust, and perished without a trace.
The only unsolved question is, why was he Stardust contamination level so incredibly high in Throughville? Could there be a Rift Entity using this place as their lair...?
