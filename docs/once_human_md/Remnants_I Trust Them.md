# Remnants/I Trust Them

I Trust Them[]

I'm a basic kind of guy, and I don't care much for reasoning, but that Black King has saved my life three times. He's fought side by side with us against those monsters and mutated beasts, and if anyone ever questioned his courage, all I can say is that that person must be blind.
Now, it's clear to everyone that days are numbered, and if Rotten Saddle is truly facing destruction and we have no better way out... Then why not trust Marcus and his brother for once? Even if it all fails, it would be no worse than sitting around here waiting to die.
I'm willing to go with them to the mountains, and so is my family.
