I admire the guy. Like everyone else, I will always be eternally grateful. If Mr. Own Hicks hadn't shown up out of the blue like some kind of god when the Starfall first hit, and got us into fighting shape, we wouldn't have been able to hold off those first few waves of Deviants. The Eastern Railway Junction would have been wiped off the face of the Earth five years go.
But, what the hell has the guy turned into? Does he even realize? Can't you guys eel it? Things aren't right.
Paul was hanged. He was guilty. But what was his crime? Stealing and opening a can of meat while on guard duty at the depot. "Dereliction of duty and violation of military discipline," "theft of vital supplies," and then he was sentenced to have by Justice Owen Hicks in a so-called "military court martial." I was there. Paul looked stunned the whole time. Even as the "military police" were dragging him out, you could tell he hadn't processed what was happening.
What will happen to this place next? Is it time to formally elect him dictator? When do we take to the streets to beg His Majesty Owen Hicks to claim his throne?
