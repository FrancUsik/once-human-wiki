# Remnants/Blue Wine

Blue Wine[]
"Broken Glass" Mandy, Marauder
Evergreen Vineyard, West Chalk Peak
September 20, ▮▮32
Shauna said she found that bottle of wine here. But it looks like someone beat us to it... Wait, no... Look at all this broken glass... Someone dud this on purpose! All this blue wine!
Why they hell would someone do that?! Was it the brewers? To keep their secret from getting out when they abandoned this place? The High Priest said that this blue wine is the sacred blood of Stardust--an extremely previous relic! That's why it's so important we track down the people who brewed it. But they must be long gone by now...
