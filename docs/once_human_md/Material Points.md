# Material Points

20,000 of this currency paid to the character every time they enter a new seasonal server, starting from their 2nd seasonal server. Maximum storage capacity is 20,000, so any points remaining at the end of the season are lost. The character can use this currency to buy items from their Spacetime Backpack, which contains seasonal items that was in their inventory and base at the end of the previous season.
