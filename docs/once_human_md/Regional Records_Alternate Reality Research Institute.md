Regional Records/Alternate Reality Research Institute[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Alternate Reality Research Institute is among the most secretive Rosetta facilities on Nalcott Island. It's tucked away in a river valley on the far eastern edge of the Red Sands, nowhere near any major settlements, and it doesn't even appear on pre-Starfall maps. Naturally, slipping past Rosetta's watchful eye to get here was no small feat..
Rumor has it they conducted extreme experiments on how stardust and Great Ones might distort time and space. These studies involve stardust, Rift Entities, and maybe even the boundaries of reality itself... After much snooping, we've only managed to confirm that a colossal array of computers and terminals are humming away day and night.
But what's the end goal of these endless calculations? Are they connected to the Starfall? We still don't know, and we nearly got caught when trying to figure it out. Let's shelf our curiosity for now and get out of here while we still can.
