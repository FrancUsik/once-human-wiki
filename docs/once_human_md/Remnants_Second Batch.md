# Remnants/Second Batch

Second Batch[]
Lydia Tiptree, the Union Explorer
Depleted Oil Well
September 3, ▮▮31
Both the upstream and downstream bridges fit the description, but I'd recommend the downstream bridge. According to Captain Denise Cooper's records, the oil well is across the bridge, while this side likely hosts a small survivor settlement. It's been five months since the letter was received. I hope the settlement still exists. The downstream area has some larger buildings that look more suitable for a settlement. Let's meet the charismatic leader Captain Cooper mentioned.
We are the second group sent from the Union to restart the oil wells. Sadly, Eli sacrificed his life for the Union and humanity. Despite reports that Eli ceased all operations after discovering the contamination, we need to verify this; after all, extracting contaminated oil would only increase the concentration of Stardust.
