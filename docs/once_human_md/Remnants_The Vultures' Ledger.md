The Vultures' Ledger[]

Helicopter Wreckage:
Only 500 kilograms were salvaged today. Frank's still slaking off. His parents really raised him well, huh?
Brandon mentioned the helicopter was taken down by a woman who could fly. She was like a superhero who knocked it out of the sky... Quite the funny one, that guy. I better have him ease up on the drinks later.
