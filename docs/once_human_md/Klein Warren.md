Summary[]
Klein Warren is the Mayor of Tall Grass Inn.

Field Guide/Personnel Files[]
Wilderness Hunter Boss
My first impression of Mayor Klein Warren wasn't good, and it was clear he disliked me too. I've rarely met someone so arrogant, so brash. Absolutely determined to live according to his own bullshit set of values, and completely incapable of taking others' advice.
He's not an idiot, though. And he's got the drive and the courage to face the consequences of his decisions. If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have been able to maintain his position for as long as he has. His settlement lies right in the heart of the most dangerous part of Nalcott Island's southern woodland. He's been leading those hunters for years now.
