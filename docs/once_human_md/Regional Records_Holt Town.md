Regional Records/Holt Town[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
As its name suggested, this is an ancestral home of the Holt family and the place Ted had long missed. Before I set out, Ted told me abut the terrain of the place, the locations of important buildings and stores, and, of course, the physical characteristics of his family members, although he had emphasized that he had no hope that they would survive.
Unfortunately, reality did not give Ted any hope but only despair - Holt Town had long been a dead town. But from the traces left behind, it was evident that the residents put up a resilient struggles. *Sigh* Regardless of age, they all held on until the last moment in the confrontation with despair... They did not give in.
The survivors at the Tall Grass also confirmed to  us the harsh truth: no one survived. We took the necessary supplies (some of them were at the places where Ted had told me they would be), and before we left, I picked a few strawflowers from the side of the road and let them drift in the breeze blowing in the direction of the of Brookham. For the loved ones of Ted Holt, we couldn't give them a proper burial, but at least, let me offer them a token a remembrance.
