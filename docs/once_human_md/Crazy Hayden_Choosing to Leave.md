Hayden,
My dear brother, I will have left Alkirk by the time you read this letter.
You're 20 years old now. I know that losing our parents was catastrophe for you, more so than for me. After all, I still have you. When mom and dad passed away, all their responsibilities were handed over to me. When you caused trouble over the years, I had to step up and deal with it, apologizing or paying to clean up the mess.
But I can't allow myself to treat you as a child anymore. Can a 20-yer-old man really still throw tantrums to get his way? I know our parents' death affected you greatly, but you can't let it rule you. There's still so much more in life to look forward to.
Practically speaking, your behavior has also affect my ability to make a living. You may hate my job, but it's been our only source on income. I hope that by leaving you here in Alkirk, I'll be forcing you to grow up and rely on yourself.
I've left some funds for you. I hope you use them well, and that we'll meet again someday.
--Elena Kilgore
