Chester still doesn't understand why I showed up before that woman, brought her to our hideout, and revealed our wine cellar's secret.
He's jealous without a doubt--but he'll come around eventually. The blue wine we brewed together, the danger and power it possesses... should not be forever confined to just two recluses. Miss Denise may not be perfect, but she's trustworthy. She's more human that Chester and I at the very least.
Our hidden sanctuary won't last much longer either. The Vultures are rising in the east, which means the banks of the Broken River will soon be theirs. The haunted old winery will no longer remain a secret Rosetta is back too. I'm not afraid of them, and neither is Chester--but we must be ready to abandon our home at any moment's notice.
