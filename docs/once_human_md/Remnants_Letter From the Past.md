# Remnants/Letter From the Past

Letter From the Past[]
Trent Palmieri, Mayor of Meyer's Market
Tall Grass Inn, East Chalk Peak
November 7, ▮▮34
Congratulations, my dear child! I'm glad you found happiness here. I believe this is what Ms. Kia wanted too.
Unfortunately, I am just not in a position to leave Meyer's Market right now, so will be unable to make it to you and Klein's wedding. Maybe next year, if the stars align. I'll be able to take a trip to Tall Grass. If you don't object to this old man's company, of course.
