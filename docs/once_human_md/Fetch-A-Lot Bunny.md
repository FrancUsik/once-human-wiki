Lore[]
Rosetta Research Documentation[]
Deviation O-016 is a rabbit doll sewn from coarse cloth, standing approximately 30 cm tall, and stuffed with cotton. It can move independently and mimic human behavior, though it lacks logical reasoning, making meaningful communication with it impossible. Despite this, the Deviation is generally friendly towards humans.
The primary trait of Deviation O-016 is its ability to induce what’s known as a “doorway effect” in humans. Within an area of about 10 square meters around the Deviation, small space portals, 40-60 cm in diameter (classified as O-016-A, also called “Rabbit Holes”), will spontaneously appear on solid surfaces. These Rabbit Holes open and close at random, leaving no residual effects when they vanish. A second Deviation O-016 often emerges from within each Rabbit Hole. The Deviation appears to exist in several variations, differing in fabric texture, stitching density, and button placement. All individuals are amicable toward one another.
When three or more individuals of Deviation O-016 gather in the same location, they engage in playful activities with clear joy, often participating in role-playing games resembling “playing house.” These dolls organize into a family-like structure, with each member adopting the role of “breadwinner,” foraging for edible plants such as sprouts, berries, and mushrooms. After gathering their food, the “breadwinner” will symbolically or ritually perform “cooking” activities. The game ends with a cheerful dance around the pile of food before each individual departs through its respective Rabbit Hole.
Notably, Deviation O-016 does not require food, water, or sleep, indicating that its activities are purely recreational or social in nature.
Securement Procedures:
DO:

Secure Deviation O-016 in a standard containment area of at least 50 square meters, with a 10-square-meter section roped off as a designated play zone.
DO NOT:

House any other Deviation within a 200-meter radius of Deviation O-016’s containment area.
Secure Deviation O-016 with other Deviations rated Level 3, particularly those that can also manipulate physical space.
Errata / Trivia[]
When the "Alice" variant was first introduced the description stated a 10% chance to bring back Acid. Players observed that it only brings back Deviated Plants, and that the description seems to belong to "Dark Rebel" instead. Accordingly, this Wiki provides descriptions that match player observations rather than the in-game text.
