# XP Farming

Completing Main and Side Quests gives not only good regular and Battlepass XP, but also Stellar Planula, which you can exchange for Starchrom.
One of the good ways of earning XP is by crafting Salt, which you can get by gathering Sea water and then boiling it at a stove. Location example is 6682, -6173, near Broken Delta.
A good way of earning XP for levels 25 - 40 in Phase 1 is the Winding Ridge Farmland located at 6095, -3651.
To get from level 40 to 50, one of the best ways is to kill enemies in Blackfell, which is going to give you good XP and Acid, which you need for crafting. To get more Acid, use the Preserved Deviated Chops, which increases the Acid gain by 50%. You can also loot everything in Blackfell, which gives the materials needed for crafting and furniture.
You can also kill Bosses for fast XP, Energy Links and Deviant drops.
