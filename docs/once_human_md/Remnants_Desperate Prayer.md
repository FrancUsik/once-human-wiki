Lord, those people just rushed in and tore all the crops out of my field without saying a word! The beets, the cabbage, the corn, everything! Not even the roots were left.
Lord, what have I done wrong? I planted diligently, irrigated, fertilized, protected my crops form insects. I didn't rest a day, I even had a contract signed to supply Gemma's Restaurant with fresh produce so I know my crops wouldn't go to waste.
Everything I have, I've lost in one night! Lord, your humble servant beseeches you to show him some mercy. Am I like Job to be tested so?
