It will take another day's boat ride to return to Rippleby. Rosetta's always moved fast, and they might already reached my hometown. There was nothing wrong with what Andrey said, Rosetta's motives are dubious, ad it was proper to decline Rosetta's invitation. It's a pity that Andrey is no longer here. The last warning he sent me was probably the result of his best efforts.
After I eat, it's back on the road... I just hope it's not too late.
