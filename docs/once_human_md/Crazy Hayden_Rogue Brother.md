Elena's brother is causing trouble again, this time ordering a feast at Gemma's restaurant and not paying the bill. It's just like when he took those clothes from Hayden's store. And then Hayden ruined things for Elena and her brother. People in town took pity on the pair before and took care of them, after they lost their parents at such a young age. And Elena's yoga classes were doing well, but now people are dropping out like flies for fear of Hayden's wrath.
I heard Elena still has a client outside Alkirk, though. I hope she can settle things with Hayden and keep this client so she at least has something to live off of.
