# Remnants/The Hiring Season

The Hiring Season[]

This month's new hires are already on the way. They're traveling by airship, and if all goes well, are expected to arrive at Central by tomorrow morning. We're still not meeting our recruitment goals, so we'll need to step up our promotional activities next month. Most of the high-causualty frontline positions have already been replaced by Neves (some of the newer models have even been assigned to officer roles), but for now, healthy human recruits are still our most valuable resource. If it proves impossible to attract enough sign-ups through promotional actives, you may also consider enforcing conscription, but please, do so with caution.
