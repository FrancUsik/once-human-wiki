Do you know how long it takes for mankind to forget its history? No, it's much less than a few generations. Ten years. Ten years is enough.
You've met my grandson, Paul, right? The one who was born just after Kailas was killed. Well, James Garland got a goddamned refrigerator fixed! It was a sight for sore eyes. There's not one functioning refrigerator in this whole stinking own, and James Garland got one! God know where he got the Freon. I can just imagine the ice cubes that thing must produce.
Can you imagine the look on Paul's face when he saw the ice? It was as if I'd told him he was looking at the world's biggest diamond. Man, it really breaks my heart to see these kids. The ones born after Starfall. They've never seen a TV, used a smartphone, or used the internet. Even refrigerators and ice cubes are rare and exciting wonders for these kids.
Everything we know is being rapidly forgotten. And I'm just afraid that, as time goes on, these kids will have less and less of an opportunity to know.
