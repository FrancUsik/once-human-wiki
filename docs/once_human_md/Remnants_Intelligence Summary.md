# Remnants/Intelligence Summary

Intelligence Summary[]
Jesse II-S0012. Rosetta Liaison Chief
Ricci Securement Point, Southeast Iron River
April 8, ▮▮29
After returning to the surface, we've had to deal with much more than expected. After all, the plan has been delayed by seven years, and Stardust seems to remain active nearly 20% longer than calculate. As a result, Rosetta's current number of personnel is not enough to conduct a large-scale search, and neither protective measures nor armed strength are sufficient. My suggestion is to concentrate what personnel and materials we have across a smaller area, increase the number of people in each squad, and distribute materials daily.
In view of the fact that the current securement measures for Deviations are not perfected, Dr. Brooks I-Fv0251 should start the relevant work as soon as possible. Any material needs can be directly applied. In addition, the S2317 Recon Squad reported that there are a small number of survivors to the northwest and south east, as well as some infants and young children born after Starfall who may have some research value.
