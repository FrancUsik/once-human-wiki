Yesterday's hunt was mixed bag. First, let's talk about the bad: the three squads expended 17 rounds of ammo, 4 rounds of pistol ammo, 11 crossbow bolts (9 retrieved), and successfully caught two bucks, three boars, three wolves (one male and two females), six turkeys, and six green-necked ducks. But, after the butchering, we got less than 70 kilograms of uncontaminated meat (including organs). Not a good deal, considering how much ammo we used.
But there was some good news - the kids have grown up. Barker Hausman, Mary-Ann Turner, Erin Dunn, and most notably, Klein Warren. These kids are downright feral. A new generation, thriving in the wake of the Starfall.
They'll be fine, even when all of us old folks are long gone.
