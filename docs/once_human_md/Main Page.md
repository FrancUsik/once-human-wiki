  About Once Human
   Once Human is a sandbox survival game. Unleashed after the opening of a mysterious interdimensional silver door, a substance called Stardust has polluted the world after Starfall, twisting it into a horrific and dangerous landscape. Following a new style, Once Human combines the rationality of science with the mysteries of the unknown. The open-world environment challenges players to survive under the pressure of extreme conditions, otherworldly creatures, and vicious humanity. Gathering resources, building homes, fighting against aberrant monsters, and more, makes it possible to survive the wilderness. Use lethal weapons and cunning tactics to unleash destructive skills to fight your way through even the toughest of places. You stand as the Meta-Humans confronting all of these ever-changing and still unknown enemies. Explore and earn your spot in a post-apocalyptic world, alone or with friends.

  Story
   There have been countless organizations secretly researching the origin of species and civilizations in human history. The most successful organization in modern times is the Rosetta, whose predecessor was the Rosetta Institute established in 1967 by a French human historian Professor Rachael-Pierre-Luberni, who discovered the Rosetta Stone. Rosetta was dedicated to the study of pre-human civilization and pan-cosmology. Then it gradually became a multinational giant in the communication and information industry in public perception, and secretly extended all around the world. Professor Luberni devoted himself to the research on the evolution of ancient human civilizations in his early years. He believed that in human history, there was a civilization that clearly transcended the boundaries of human thinking and ability at that time. Exploring the secrets behind these civilizations would help mankind bring new changes to the modern civilization that had been completely stagnant. With the support of his friend and collaborator Samuel Lowe, Luberni obtained the Rosetta Stone in 1967 and deduced the material from it that did not belong to the Earth.
