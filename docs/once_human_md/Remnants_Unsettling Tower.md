That black tower... They say it's the latest and safest in energy production, but it gives me the willies every time I look at it.
We got another order, and Randall just went out to prepare the delivery for it. This time, he'll be going over with the delivery team. It's Rosetta's 13th order with us. Obviously everything is developing for the better, but I feel like there'sa heavy stone pressing down on my chest. I often wake up in the middle of the night, gaping for breath, full of regret. And when I look out the window and see that black tower, it just gets worse...
