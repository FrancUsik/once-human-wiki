Summary[]
White Cliff is located in Blackheart at 3463,1190.

History[]
White Cliff is one of the most impenetrable military bases on Nalcott Island. It's Rosetta's military hub on the island, run by their top researchers and protected like a fortress.
"What could they be researching?" People are guessing all kinds of things, but Rosetta hasn't said a word--just sent their top armed unit to guard the place. No one knows if any of the rumors are true, but one thing's for sure: White Cliff is getting ready for something big. And whatever it is, it could change the future of Nalcott Island &#91;1&#93;.
