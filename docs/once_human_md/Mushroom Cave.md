Summary[]
Mushroom Cave is a player-named location in Nalcott which earned its name for being a location abundant in Mushroom clusters. 

Location[]
Mushroom Cave runs below ground along the south of Sunbury. Although it is referred to as a "Cave" it is actually large cavern accessible from multiple entrances including (5121,-6841), (5102,-6955), (4624,-7010), (4730,-7090), and (4909,-7076). The entrance at (5121,-6841) is directly north of a Teleportation Tower making it the most convenient. The cave is large enough that by the time the player has finished clearing the resources, they will have already begun to respawn at the other end of the cave.

Resources and Wildlife[]
While Mushroom Cave is best-known for its abundance of Mushroom, here players can also find an abundance of Scarlet Calamus, which are required for crafting Fertilizer - Breeding Boost, and a decent amount of Yellow Lotus. In addition, there are Tin Ore and Copper Ore nodes throughout the caves.
Along the Western and Southern entrances, players will find as many as a dozen Capybara, and on the Eastern entrances will find just as many Deer. This makes the caves convenient for harvesting Rawhide, Deer Meat, and Beast Meat.
