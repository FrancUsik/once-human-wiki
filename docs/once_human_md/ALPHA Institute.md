Summary[]
ALPHA Institute is located in Chalk Peak at -35,-3787.

History[]
Once a research base for Rosetta, it was quickly abandoned in the wake of the Starfall. Then, the residents of Greenlake Hill arrived, scavenging all available supplies and equipment before departing, leaving this place deserted once more.
But a man named Isaac Finn stayed behind. A teacher who remained hopeful amidst the end of the days, Isaac planned to transform the abandoned institute into a school to teach the children of Greenlake Hill before the knowledge of past eras was lost to time.
At least initially, Isaac's passionate idea was supported by some of Greenlake Hill's key individuals, who provided some resources and manpower to renovate the place and worked on collecting worn-out pre-Starfall books. He compiled them into teaching materials for children, who, like the adults, were numbed by their daily struggle for survival, to come and learn...
Hope is a flower that may not bear fruit. Despite Isaac's efforts, he ultimately failed. The whole school program was discarded, and the children still went to the workshops and farms. As for the old books, they were likely used as firewood for a meal.
It is unknown what became of Isaac as many traces of him were erased after Rosetta reoccupied the place &#91;1&#93;.
