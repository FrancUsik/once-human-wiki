Characteristics[]
Anyone who receives a balloon from an Ede will transform into a Customer. With their burdened heads replaced by lightweight, inflated balloons, they lose all desires save for an insatiable thirst for joy. On one of the balloons that forms this Deviant’s head, a crudely drawn, emotionless face can be found—smeared and unsettling in its simplicity.

Behavior[]
Customers roam aimlessly in the locations where their human forms were corrupted by an Ede. Despite their sluggish appearance, do not underestimate them. Upon detecting a threat, they sprint with alarming speed, using basic but effective physical attacks to harm their targets.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the balloon with the face drawn on it.

Locations[]
Customers are low-ranking enemies commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Drops[]
Customers either drop various scrap materials or Acid.
