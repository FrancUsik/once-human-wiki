They wear black suits, and have a briefcase with a large mouth a long tongue in place of a head that drip[s] slimy saliva. Agents can spit their saliva like a cannonball. Their spit is mixed with moist and decaying banknotes, and in this post-Starfall world, they are perhaps the only ones to cling to money of old."

Description[]
Agents are anima enemies, their deformed features are a result of Starfall. They are one of the organisms that have been contaminated by Stardust and undergone partial decay. Agents can be found all around the wilderness of Nalcott. However, their first appearance is in the tutorial, where the game introduces you to Anima Weapons, which can be controlled with the player's Telekinetic Hand until their durability runs out, which will then cause the player to automatically drop the anima weapon and be unable to pick it back up.

Attack[]
Agents attack at range by spitting large globs of saliva at the player, or attack at close range like other deviants by hitting the player, both attacks do increasing damage as the enemies' level increases.

Loot[]
Loot from Agents are the same as other deviants, consisting of various junk items and acid.
