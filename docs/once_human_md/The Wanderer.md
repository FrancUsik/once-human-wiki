 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			The Wanderer... wandering. (FRONT) 		 	 
The Wanderer is a towering six legged bus cross Starfall hybrid creature, with it's towering stature and the booming noise of it's movement as each foot hits the road below it, it's hard for players to not feel scared upon their first time meeting face-to-shin with this deviant.
The Wanderer is not directly a hostile enemy, it will never out-right cause damage to the player. However, if the player gets too close six Gnawers will crawl out of the ground and, if in sight, will start to chase after the player. The level of these Gnawers depends on the location the bus was found, the estimated level for the Gnawers in each region of Nalcott in the Manibus scenario are listed:

Dayton Wetlands: level 10
Broken Delta: level 20
Iron River: level 25
Chalk Peak: level 30
Red Sands: level 40
Blackheart Region: level 50
Looting[]
Inside the bus part of the deviant is a Storage Crate, which can be looted once every real life day. Inside of the crate there can be various items, mainly these will include  energy linksbody[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .energy-links-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)}, adrenaline shots, and throwables.

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			The Wanderer bent down. (BACK) 		 	 
To get inside of the bus the player must focus their attacks on the Wanderer's legs, as they are the only part of the body that take damage. The player will know when to stop attacking when they hear a horn and see the legs of the Wanderer start to bend. Once the Wanderer's legs are fully bent and the back of the bus is touching the floor, the player can go inside and retreive the crate.

Location[]
The Wanderer travels all across the roads, and can be found in all areas of Nalcott. One of the confirmed locations is near the settlement in Chalk Peak, the Tall Grass Inn.

Trivia[]
Players can stay inside of the Wanderer and take no damage, using it as a way to get around.
