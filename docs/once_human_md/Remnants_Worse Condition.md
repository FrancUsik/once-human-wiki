Damn it... My back is getting worse and worse, and now the blue spots have spread to my limbs and chest... Those quacks in Paisley Plaza don't know what to do. They just gave me some anti-inflammatory ointment and sent me on my way. I heard that Rosetta has built a new hospital in the Dayton Wetlands. I have to go there. It's gonna be expensive, but I gotta get this treated. What's more important life...? I'll skip my shift and go there tomorrow.
