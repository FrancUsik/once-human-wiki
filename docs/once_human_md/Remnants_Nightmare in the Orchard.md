Nightmare in the Orchard[]
Rick Handel, Fruit Farmer
Sutherland Vineyard, South Dayton Wetlands
May 8. ▮▮18
It's all very strange, outrageous even. A fantasy? No, this can only be some kind of nightmare. I've never seen such ideal growing conditions on Nalott Island, not in all my life. This should've been a bumper harvest for apples, or grapes, the soil has never been so fertile. And so it was. In terms of appearance at least, this year's fruit was indeed much bigger than in previous harvests. And yet...
The fruit was emitting an eerie blue glow, that seemed to be coming from in between the delicate stems and leaves. In the juicy flesh, too, there was always this strange hint of eerie blue light.
I warned Ms. Anne that these fruits were not safe for consumption, not for juicing or brewing. I told her that any responsible farmer would dump the lot into the compost pit without hesitation.
Fortunately, Ms. Anne is no fool. She agreed that I should get someone to dispose of all the strange-looking fruit, but she insisted several times that this work must be carried out in secret. 
She didn't say it outright, but I know she was afraid of something...
No, she's scared of those guys out west. The ones who built that tall Black Tower... The light that has begun to emanate from that tower... is just the same eerie shade of blue.
