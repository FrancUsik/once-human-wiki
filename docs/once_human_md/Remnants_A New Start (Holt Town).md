# Remnants/A New Start (Holt Town)

A New Start[]

Business is getting harder and harder. Many people have swarmed to our ton, most of them are old and sick with no money. The Holt family has literally turned the whole town into some kind of charitable refuge. They even let oil workers who are sick and retired it.
There will be problems before long. I've decided, it's time for me to leave.
That rest stop out west should be completed soon, and there are still a few storefronts that haven't been rented out. I think I've got enough saved up to rent one of them and use it sell fast food or something. Patricia also needs a change of environment to make some playmates her own age. She hasn't smiled much since she lost her father. Staying in this dying town isn't doing her much good.
