My dear sister, we want to do all we can to make things easier for Ms. Kia, right?
Those two little girls are too small, too skinny. They can barely work, let alone go out and find supplies. I don't see why we should waste our precious rations on these freeloaders.
Ms. Kia made the same mistake as the people at Sunbury Farm - taking in too many people who just TAKE TAKE TAKE, but never contribute. Ms. Kia will surely come to regret her kindness towards these people. It's too late for the farm. They're doomed. But we can't just stand by and watch this place fall into the same trap.
So, come and lend a helping hand, Maxie. We an deal with the problem quickly, and without causing panic.
