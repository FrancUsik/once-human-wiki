Nothing to eat, nothing to eat anywhere, and I've been hungry for three days. I don't dare to eat exposed food t that stuff's all infected by Stardust. There used to be a lot of canned food here, that's the safest thing for people to eat now.
I've had 50 cans of spam over the past 30 days, and I've been fortunate enough to not face any Deviants head on. They all walked past the closed gates, and I don't think they had any idea of opening the door to search in here. The problem is that there's so many Deviants out there, there are different ones passing by every day. I can't go out, I don't have any means of transportation, and I don't have any weapons. I'm trapped in a dead end. But if I stay, I'll face a demise that is less painful than being eaten, but more protracted: starvation.
