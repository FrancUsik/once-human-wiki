# Animals

Animals can be found all throughout Nalcott, with some preferring to roam only in certain sections of the wilderness. After Starfall some animals, such as wolves, crocodiles, and bears, became corrupt, causing their bodies to be mangled and stripped of any personality they once had. Although, not all animals from the same genus were corrupted, some remain empowered by the events of Starfall and are now known as eclipse animals.
