# Memetic

Memetics grant Formulas that players can use to build and craft in Once Human. Memetics are obtained by spending Ciphers, also known as memetic points or meme points, on memetic nodes. Players can earn ciphers by Leveling (4x ciphers per level), completing Season Goals (Phase Rewards), and capturing each Deviation species for the first time each season (3x ciphers per deviation). There are also memetic specilizations, where four are randomly selected for each player to pick one every time they level up 5 levels, click here to read more.
The memetics tree is broken down into 4 different pages: Infrastructure, Crafting, Logistics, and Building. Inside of these pages there are 5 different sections:

Awakening
Empowerment
Ascendance
Transcendence
Enlightenment
The first and second sections, Awakening and Empowerment, are unlocked from the start of the scenario in phase one. The other three sections are later unlocked in the second phase: Tame the Staroid.
