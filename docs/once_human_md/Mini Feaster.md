Story[]
Deviation O-044 is a doll that stands 70 centimeters tall and weighs 12 kilograms. It wears a yellow hooded robe made of burlap, and its face is concealed by a deep crimson mask embroidered with three eye-like patterns. Purple, tentacle-like appendages are visible protruding from the bottom of its robe.
O-044 is capable of autonomous movement, exhibits extremely high intelligence, and is fluent in all known languages. It is adept at conversation, and consistently displaying a friendly and easygoing demeanor. Its interactions are often performative or theatrical in nature. (Note by Professor ■■■, Supervisor of site ■■: Do not trust O-044; it is devoid of any semblance of empathy and represents something wholly different from any Deviation we have ever encountered before.)
The primary Deviation Traits manifested by O-044 are narrative contamination and reality manipulation at very advanced levels. It can freely alter any information recorded about itself, including, but not limited to, documents, audio-visual materials, and declarative memories. It is also capable of modifying reality-past and present-to align with these altered records.
All human subjects (designated O-044-A) exposed to O-044 will develop a strong intention and passion for creative activity, even if they have not previously received any literary for artistic education. Works produced by O-044-A always feature nihilistic themes and a gloomy surrealistic style, yet maintain an indescribable allure. Prolonged exposure to O-044 will result in pronounced ■■ tendencies.
Interview Record O-044-I-001
Date: ■■\■■\■■Location: Securement Unit ■■■■Interviewers: Director ■■■■and Professor ■■■
Director ■■■■: Good morning, O-044. It's a pleasure to meet you.
O-044: Good morning, sir. No need for such formality. Call me ■■■■... Oh, excuse me...
(Securement Unit ■■ is sanitized. Professor ■■■ enters the Securement Unit.)
O-044: *sigh* Alright then. Call me O-044.
Professor ■■■: Let's continue. We have some questions for you. You may choose not to answer if you feel uncomfortable. Is that alright?
O-044: Of course.
Professor ■■■: Can you tell us where you're from?
O-044: Maybe this will work. I come from the world of Identity ■!
Professor ■■■: Identity ■?
O-044: Yes. By your understanding, it's a... video game, I suppose?
Professor ■■■: A video game? So you're saying you're a character from a video game?
O-044: *shrugs* Exactly. Isn't this world a video game too?
Professor ■■■: *long pause* Then, am I a video game character as well?
O-044: Of course, dear lady. You exist only in this file's text. You don't even have a real name-just these black blocks as placeholders. When this file is closed by the "player", you'll no longer interact with the real world.
Professor ■■■: You... Sorry, I'm finding this quite hard to believe.
O-0nds in a celebratory posture* But isn't it splendid news? Your world will soon face numerous crises capable of destroying it multiple times over. It will be a magnificent spectacle. And you, as the director of this site, will have the safest and best seat in the house, right here in our conversation, right inside this story!
Professor ■■■: I'll try to understand. What is your purpose for coming to our world?
O-044: To wait for a character called the Meta-Human. And have them secure me as a Deviation. After all, they are the protagonist of this world. Like I said, a spectacular show is going to unfold in this world, and I'm going to have a front-row seat.
Professor ■■■: Secured? What about us, then? What will happen to Rosetta?
O-044: *remains silent*
O-044: Don't overthink it, and don't dwell on what I've said before, madam. We won't be seeing each other for quite some time.
After Professor ■■■ signed a confidentiality agreement, she was appointed director of Site ■■.
Securement Procedures:DO:Secure O-044 in a Grade VII or higher securement unit for autonomous entities installed with Grade IX psychohazard equipment.Wear a psychohazard barrier before interacting with O-044.It is wise to protect yourself when facing the unknown.
DO NOT:Perform any stress or obedience tests of O-044.Why not give it a try?Implement additional safety measures. They are unnecessary.
