Summary[]
Sunshine Farm is located in Blackheart at 2855,-322.

History[]
According to the records, Sunshine Farm was once Nalcott's newest and most fancy solar-thermal power plant, built on an absurdly large scale and briefly touted as a half-baked tourist spot. There's even a rumor that, before the Starfall, Rosetta tried to buy it from the Sutherland family, but the deal never went through. 
Now those crazy Vultures run the place &#91;1&#93;.
