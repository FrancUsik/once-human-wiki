Get Mary-Ann and Mark, and we'll leave tonight. The rest area itself has a small inn (Tall Grass, as they like to call it), so we can stay there, pay up for a month or so, then see what happens. By th way, we need to call Robert, Qing Liu, and Xianghui Huang and ask them what they think about it. If there's really some kind of unstoppable disaster about to happen, we should tell them to bring supplies as soon as possible and rush to the agreed meeting place.
I hope I'm just being paranoid, and that the blue light coming form the Monolith is really just a standard commissioning procedure for the energy facilities, as the Mayor and the others have said...
