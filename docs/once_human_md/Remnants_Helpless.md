Isabel Brunno, Doctor
Paisley Plaza, East Chalk Peak

Paisley Plaza isn't a big place. Not much in the way of equipment, no proper pharmacy, no surgical facilities. Even a simple appendectomy is beyond us. Just last week, Old Archie Dodd was rushed in by his son. He was suffering from acute gastroenteritis, but all I could do was write a referral and send them off to Greenlake Hospital ASAP. Sadly, poor old Archie had several underlying conditions, and wasn't strong enough for that kind of journey. He died somewhere on the mountain road.
That was when I finally decided to send in my resume to Rosetta's medical services department. I heard Rosetta are planning to set up camp in Nalcott Island, and their new Monolith will bring some much-needed investment to the region, including a new hospital. I'd give my right arm to get a job in a real modern hospital. Hell, I'd even start as a nurse and work my way up.
