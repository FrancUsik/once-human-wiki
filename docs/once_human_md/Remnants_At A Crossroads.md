I had another fight with Klein last night, the third this week. It seems that as soon as we start communicating, the fire of resentment in our hearts immediately spills out.
It feels like our marriage is on its last legs. Klein... He's not been himself since he came back from... The hunt... He was the lone survivor against the Silent Beast, and everything changed. While I can imagine how grueling the battle was, with the sacrifice made by his companions and that Mayfly, Klein was ultimately victorious, right? The Silent Beast was defeated, and he became a hero, and, then later, a Mayor. But why is it that I have come to recognize you less and less, my once dear husband?
