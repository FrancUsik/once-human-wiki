# Regional Records/Refinery Pollution Point

Regional Records/Refinery Pollution Point[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Before the Starfall, this place was full of young people putting in their hours and chasing their dreams. There used to be a fleet of trucks working around the clock, taking finished goods to customers, and bringing in raw materials for smelting in the factory. It was only a medium-sized refinery at best, but it did good business and paid its workers a fair wage. I imagine all this must seem very strange to the younger generation. The Union has done its best to maintain some semblance of social order but still. The world is so unimaginably different now.
But what's the use in dwelling on the past? The refinery was abandoned after the Starfall, and now it stands empty. Some survivors must have taken refuge in there at some point though - I saw the remains of campfire, and some small tents. It was late at night when Stardust first spread to the refinery, and there were only a few kids on guard duty at the time. They didn't stand a chance. Some of them probably wander the halls of the refinery even now, in a new, twisted form...
The last bit is conjecture.
The facts of our exploration are as follows: we cleared out a few monsters, then conducted a detailed search of the location. It was practically deserted, and we found almost nothing of value, just some metals. No food whatsoever. We're running dangerously low on rations at the moment. If we don't find food in the next week, the expedition... No. We've still got some time. It's not over yet.
