Regional Records/Fort Eyrie[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Fort Eyrie--this wretched place shouldn't exit, yet it stands defiantly atop the ruins at the southern edge of the Red Sands, attracting the greediest and most savage Vultures like a hunk of rotting flesh.
From our pickup truck, we spotted that strange colossus in the distance. Like a behemoth of twisted steel, its crooked floors and crisscrossing protrusions spiraled outward in otherworldly fashion. It hardly seemed to belong to this world. Staring at that paradoxical structure made me uneasy--it resembled a forgotten nightmare, a ghost town forsaken by the world, yet stubbornly clinging to existence.
Where did it come from? Records suggest that this place was once a national park and archaeological site. Today, however, Fort Eyrie is the throne of the Vultures--a restricted zone where none may enter, looming over the shattered land like a menacing inquisitor. Trust me--we should leave before those deranged Vultures find us.
