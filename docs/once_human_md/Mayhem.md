Characteristics[]
When an individual succumbs to advanced Stardust infection, they can evolve into a Mayhem. The Mayhem is characterized by a grotesque, bloody mouth that replaces its head, opening directly from the neck. Surrounding this maw is a mass of highly developed tentacle-like cells, resembling a mane of long, wiry hair.

Behavior[]
The Mayhem moves on all fours, relentlessly patrolling its territory in search of prey. Upon spotting a target, it launches into a swift and aggressive pursuit, lunging and gnawing with savage intensity until its victim is subdued. 

Tips[]
To maximize damage, aim for the mouth.&#160;

Locations[]
Mayhems are low-ranking enemies commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Drops[]
Mayhems either drop various scrap materials or Acid.
