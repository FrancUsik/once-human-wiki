Summary[]
Once Human has a concept referred to as Scenarios which define major aspects of gameplay.
Although a Scenario defines the activities of a Season, pedantically Scenarios are not Seasons. A Season defines a timeline for events such as start dates, phase periods, etc whereas a Scenario defines the overall theme of the Season, including specifics of each phase, Deviation availability, any special tags, items, etc which are "season bound", and similar.

PVE Scenarios[]
Manibus (July-2024)[]
At game launch the primary PVE Scenario was Manibus, named after a massive sky-bound Great One that is introduced during the scenario's final phase. This scenario introduces The Union and has you travelling between Union Strongholds and Monoliths for progression.
It is expected that this will serve as the "introductory" Scenario for new players as future PVE scenarios are unlocked, but only time will tell.

The Way of Winter (October-2024)[]
The developers have announced that a new PVE scenario will become available Q4-2024 (tentatively September/October) entitled The Way of Winter.
