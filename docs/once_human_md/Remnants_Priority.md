Damn those cheating bastards! I did so much for them, even contributed to the first batch of test subjects for their human experiments. All in exchange for this locked bunker and a group of Rosetta bodyguards. Leaving aside the question of whether I need to be protected in such a completely enclosed place, this bunker has no supplies at all. Does Shane want me to starve to death here? Although I got a lot of oil and water from Rosetta, there's one one thing left unfinished. Simply put, it'll take Rosetta an extra two years to finish building its black tower without me.
Rosetta's dumbass regulations must say something like: "helping Rosetta is not enough for preferential treatment, people must be given priority based on current needs." Those bodyguards are all staring at me, but I'm the one who should get priority now...
