Good news, Rosetta paid up, just as promised. From now on, this shitty place belongs to them.
Doesn't matter what happens to this place now. It's no longer our problem! I just don't get why Helena is so worried. We've got money now. We're richer than about 90% of Nalcott residents, I reckon. We should go to the Western Harbor and have a good time. I'm getting sick of looking at that miserable face, I've got to say...
