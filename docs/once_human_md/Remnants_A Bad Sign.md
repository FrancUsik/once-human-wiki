# Remnants/A Bad Sign

A Bad Sign[]

We are continuing to detect deviated signals, but less frequently than in the previous quarter. The technical department has been unable to track the source of the signals so far, having traced several signals to the deep sea and remote wilderness. I have formally requested to classify this signal as a Deviation, with the temporary designation "Deviation-M955," and arranged for personnel to be stationed at the Gaia communication array to monitor the situation 24/7. In the even that a Deviated signal is received again, staff have been instructed to respond with the phrase "All is well, abort launch sequence."
