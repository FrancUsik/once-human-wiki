Characteristics[]
The Glutton is a fearsome deviant found across various regions of Nalcott. These creatures lack a traditional head structure; instead, they feature a large fissure resembling a flower bud, which serves as both a mouth and a weapon for attacking and consuming prey. A Glutton’s mouthparts, resembling petals, continuously open and close as they regulate the flow of tissue fluid throughout their bodies. When a Glutton prepares to spread Stardust, its mouthparts bloom like a flower in full bloom.
While most Gluttons stand at 2-3 times the height of an average human, Titan variants of the Glutton can also be found roaming Nalcott. These Glutton Titans tower upwards of 10 times the size of their smaller counterparts. The mechanism differentiating regular Gluttons from Glutton Titans remains unknown, though several theories exist—ranging from the abilities of the human host to a possible secondary mutation triggered by Stardust.

Behavior[]
Gluttons can launch projectiles that home in on their prey and create puddles from which smaller Deviants emerge. Additionally, their psionic abilities allow them to generate powerful shockwaves by stomping, creating large ripples that disrupt the area.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, focus on the glowing clusters of Stardust on their legs. Destroying all clusters will disorient the Glutton, causing it to collapse temporarily to its knees. This exposes the weak spot within its mouthparts, making it significantly easier to deal damage.

Field Guide/Dangerous Entities[]
I - The Gluttonous
This fearsome behemoth is known as a Glutton.
It does not have a head structure at all, but instead simply a huge fissure in the shape of a flower bud. Strictly speaking, this could be classified as the beast's mouth, used for both attacking and devouring prey.
II - Ready to Bloom
A Glutton's mouthparts look a lot like petals, constantly opening and closing. This is how Gluttons control the flow a tissue fluid in and out of their bodies. Once a Glutton is ready to spread Stardust, its mouthparts bloom, just like a real flower. Using a pressure-based mechanism, it then spews out a burst of concentrated Stardust into the air.
The glutton also uses this method to attack and infect enemies.
