Summary[]
At one time, the Dayton Wetlands was under the complete control of one family - the Sutherlands.

Rosetta's Investment in Nalcott[]
Rosetta's entry into Nalcott began by establishing a working relationship the Sutherland family, serving as their gateway to gain a foothold on the island. Several members of the family welcomed the partnership as they viewed Rosetta's plans as a promising opportunity to link commercial centers across the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. However, Anne Sutherland, the family's matriarch, was skeptical and cautious about placing trust in the newcomers.

Businesses[]
Overlook Town[]
The Sutherland family had been investing heavily in Overlook Town, with the grand aim of making it into a thriving new settlement. Most of the town's real estate, the motel, the supermarkets, and most of the other commercial properties all belonged to one certain member of the Sutherland family.

Sutherland Family Orchard[]
Sutherland Chemical Plant[]
After surviving Starfall, the workers at the Sutherland Chemical Plant became desperate and scared, blaming the Sutherland Family for the catastrophe.  Driven into madness by their fear, the workers decided to "deal with" the plant managers - brothers Donald and Nelson Sutherland - themselves, before turning their uncontrollable anger on the rest of the Sutherland family.

Known Family Members[]
Anne Sutherland[]
Anne Sutherland was an elegant lady, widely admired by those who knew her. She had been widowed not long into her marriage, leaving her with two young children to raise alone. She managed the orchard and all the surrounding farmland herself.

Donald and Nelson Sutherland[]
Not much is known about the brothers, except how they died - at the hands of the scared and angry works they managed at the Sutherland Chemical Plant.

Eli Sutherland[]
Jesse Sutherland[]
Jesse Sutherland was the youngest member of the Sutherland family and the most highly respected among the younger generation. He was the nephew of the patriarch and managed most of the family's resources before the Starfall. He was an overbearing, fearless, and ruthless man, famed for his greed and profligacy. Throughville was a luxury estate and Jesse Sutherland's home before the Starfall. Tightly guarded and well-equipped, the estate was where Jesse stored most of this vast wealth, which he had extracted from the Dayton Wetlands and surrounding areas. No one knows how Jesse Sutherland met his end, because none of Throughville's residents managed to escape with their lives.

Joan Sutherland[]
Keefer Sutherland[]
Trivia[]
