Blackfell Oil Fields[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
After the Starfall, the Blackfell Oil Fields lay silent in the Red Sands like a wounded beast - still breathing, still bleeding, still keeping Blackfell and the Union alive.
In the aftermath of the Starfall, the world's order collapsed, and deviation spread faster than we could respond. The oil wells shut down. Some workers died, others fled. The entire field turned into a haven for Deviants, and no one dared go near it. It wasn't until the Union got a foothold in Blackfell that they finally made a move. They sent a small team - armed, supplied, and holding onto a bit of shaky optimism - into the oil field. They set up a supply station on the outskirts and began clearing the outer areas. If something could be repaired, they fixed it. If not, they destroyed it. The goal was simple: do whatever they could to recover even the smallest amount of production capability. No one expected it to return to how it was before the Starfall. But even the smallest output of energy could keep the lights on in Blackfell for a few more hours. Slowly, the oil field started working again.
It wasn't the nonstop, large-scale production of the old days - just the bare minimum to survive. The long-idle machines came back to life, slowly drawing up the last remaining black gold from underground. That energy was sent back to Blackfell, helping it hang on for just a little longer.
