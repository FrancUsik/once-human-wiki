These allow every character unlocking special seasonal recipes for new or improved buildings or inventory items, or increasing the limit of the number of buildings in certain categories (e.g. more generators or structural parts) in the seasonal server. Note that none of these bonuses will be available in Eternaland. Every 5 levels of the character starting from level 5, a Memetic Specialization node will be unlocked, which offers a choice among 4 randomly generated Specializations, one from each branch of Gathering, Crafting, Management and Building, up to 10 possible specializations at level 50.

Effects[]
Effect Types[]
Each specialization grants one of the 4 effects to the unlocking character (note - not to their base, nor any facilities in their base, which are instead consequential whent he unlocking character chooses to utilize any of the 4 unlocked effects):

Unlock New Formula: the character gains a new formula that they can use on both boosted and non-boosted facilities at their base and bases of their friends that allow access. They do NOT have to unlock any memetic, provided they have access to the relevant crafting facility at any seasonal base, or can gain this access in the future. Some formulas allow crafting only 1 type of item, (e.g. "Art of Stardust Decay"), some allow crafting 3 "levels" of the same item with each "level" offering improved performance but requiring progressively rarer ingredients (note that "level" is not indicated in the item's description but is inferred from it, e.g. Load Handling "level 1" is the version of the item that offers 40% weight reduction, "level 2" - 60% weight reduction, while "level 3" - 80% weight reduction), and some allow crafting several different items (e.g. "Precious Metal Refining" gives 2 separate formulas - one for crafting Gold Ingots and the other one - for Silver Ingots). Taking "Art of Stardust Decay" as an example - this specialization allows the unlocking character to craft Acid from Stardust Source using Electric Furnaces (including both basic Electric Furnaces and Electric Furnaces improved with other specializations) at any base to which they are given access, including their own base and bases of their friends that give access, including Furnaces built before this effect was acquired. In this case the character needs to have access to Electric Furnace, which they must either have at their base already, or if not - then unlock it later via Memetics and build one to be able to benefit from this effect.
Improved Formula: similar to "Unlock New Formula", except the character receives a formula replacement for a specific basic formula, rather than a new formula in addition to the ones they have already (i.e. the character loses an ability to craft the non-improved item on their current seasonal server). The character needs to unlock the memetic of the non-improved formula to be able to benefit from this effect, either before or after obtaining this effect. Improved formula will require the same ingredients and crafting time, and the output item will have improved or additional bonuses to those of the basic non-improved item. Example: "Pickaxe: Moonlight Mining" will allow the character to craft improved pickaxes that give a better ore yield, losing the ability to craft the non-improved versions of pickaxes on their current seasonal server.
Unlock New Facility: similar to "Unlock New Formula", except this one is for a building that the character can build both at their base and bases of their friends that allow access. They do NOT need to unlock any relevant/similar memetic to be able to build the new facility. Example: "Large Refinery Facility" allows the unlocking character to build an improved version of Small Refinery Facility, and they do not need to unlock the "Fuel Refinery" memetic, which if they have unlocked - they can safely reset to reallocate Memetic Ciphers for better use and still continue to be able to build Large Refineries.
Facility Boost: similar to "Improved Formula", but for either a single facility (i.e. a building) or a category of facilities, which can be built both at their base and at bases of their friends that allow access. The character needs to unlock the memetic of the facility/facilities being boosted to be able to benefit from this effect, either before or after obtaining this effect. Boosted facility will require the same ingredients, and the resulting facility will have improved or additional bonuses to those of the basic non-boosted facility. Note that existing facilities already built are not automatically boosted upon acquiring this effect, and must be demolished and re-built for the bonus to be applied to them. Example: Generator: Electrical Expert will allow character with fully unlocked Memetics tree to build not just 6, but 7 generators at any base to which they are given access, including their own base and bases of their friends that give access. Be cognizant that since all specialization effects apply to the character unlocking them, and not to the base of the character, so any generator built by the character with this specialization will have +2 W output, however generators built already at the base of this character will not have the +2 W output bonus, until they are demolished and re-built. Similarly, if this character's friend with building rights but without any specializations visits this character's seasonal base, they would not be able to build more than 6 generators, even though the owner of the base has this effect unlocked. Conversely, with appropriate friend's building rights, this character will be able to build more than 6 generators on their friend's seasonal base (if they have "Power Upgrade - II" memetics unlocked).
Effect Scope[]
All effects apply to a character and not to their base. Then, as regards to the relevant item/facility crafted/built by the character, the effect can apply either to a single item/facility, a list of items/facilities, or a category of items/facilities. Examples: 

"Art of Stardust Decay" only applies to "Electric Furnace", but not to "Furnace".
"Furnace: Sintering" applies to both "Furnace" and "Electric Furnace".
"Reinforced Structures: Healing Defense" applies to any structure that is in a "reinforced" category (in this case it includes the following categories: Enhanced Support, Small Enhanced Support, Enhanced Roofs, Enhanced Doors &amp; Windows, Small Enhanced Roofs, Enhanced Stairs, Enhanced Curved Structures).
Effect Stacking[]
Effects from different specializations stack with each other, unless specialization description has the phrase "Effect cannot stack". Stacking will only apply to exact effects/facilities/groups of facilities mentioned. Notable examples:

"Load Handling" has the phrase, therefore placing more than 1 "Load Handling" item in your inventory will not provide further benefit beyond that provided by the 1st one.
"Generator: Electrical Expert" and "Hydraulic Generator: One with the Tides" both increase the limit of generators for the unlocking character by 1, and they will stack on each other, allowing a character that selected them both and also unlocked "Power Upgrade - II" memetic to build not just any 6, but any 8 generators (note - not only hydraulic generators, but any 8 generators, e.g. they could build 8 photon generators) at any seasonal base once both specializations are unlocked.
"Electric Furnace: Efficiency Lover" and "Furnace: Sintering" effects will stack on Electric Furnaces, allowing Glass and Sintered Bricks to be produced instantly.
"Large Refinery Facility" and "Refining Facility: Smelting" will stack with each other, i.e. it will be possible to refine Sulfur into Hot Rock Ore in Large Refinery Facility, because the game mechanics considers it a type of refining facility.
"Solar Drill" and "Electric Drill: Treasure Hunter" will stack with each other, because the game mechanics considers Solar Drill to be a sub-type of an Electric Drill.
Memetic Cleansers[]
A character can use Memetic Cleansers to reset their Specializations on the Memetic Specialization screen. These are inventory items found in "Materials" tab, and at most 5 can be obtained in each Season by completing Season Goals. They are season-exclusive and will disappear after the season ends. Each Cleanser weights 0.000 and is linked to the obtaining character - which therefore means that they cannot be discarded, placed in storage creates or traded to other characters.
When consuming a Cleanser, a new list of 5 choices will be generated, which will include both the original choice, and a brand new list of 4 new choices, one from each branch, which will not necessarily match the original list that the character had prior to selecting the current choice. The new choice does not have to be picked immediately and will remain open for the character to choose until the end of the season.
Any items/facilities crafted/built with this specialization will persist after the specialization is reset. Example: constructing Deluxe Storage Crates from the same specialization then resetting it with a cleanser will not destroy the crates, and they will still remain in the base.

Memory Fragments[]
Additionally, up to 3 specialization replacements per season can be made by consuming Memory Fragments. These are inventory items found in "Special" tab that are randomly added to a character inventory with a low chance when consuming a Controller to open boss loot. Like Memetic Cleansers, Fragments are too season-exclusive and will disappear after the season ends. Each Fragment weights 0.000, but unlike Cleansers - is not linked to a character and can thus be both stored in storage crates and traded between characters, however a character will not be able to consume more than 3 per season even if they obtained more than 3.
As with cleansers, replacing a specialization will not remove/destroy items/facilities created from the specialization being replaced.

Identities[]
Unlocking 2 Memetic Specializations within the same branch grants you a unique "Identity" related to that branch, which you can showcase to other players, however it is aesthetic only as it offers no functional bonuses.

It was supplemented with additional community-supplied details (in italics) that players might find relevant (such as formula ingredients and crafting time, list of applicable structures, stacking outcomes with other specializations).
Branches are listed in the order they appear in the memetic specialization selection screen. Specializations are listed in alphabetic order by default, but can be sorted differently by clicking on the desired column header. Tier column is available to allow sorting by increasing/decreasing level (tier 1 is level 5/10/15, 2 is 20/25/30/35, 3 is 40/45/50).

PVE Scenarios[]
The following specializations are available in PVE scenarios (currently these are Manibus and The Way of Winter). Where a specialization is still unknown to occur in a scenario by the community - it will be suffixed by&#160;?, you can remove the question mark if you encounter that specialization in that scenario.
