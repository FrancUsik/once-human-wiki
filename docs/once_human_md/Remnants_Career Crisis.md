Jeffery,
I just wanted to send you a message letting you know I'm not teaching Rafael yoga anymore. I think he found a better teacher. I'm not professional enough, or good at talking. Rafael's been worrying a lot recently, and you know I'm not good at comforting people.
Actually, Rafael was my last student, so I guess I'm unemployed now, embarrassing as it is to say. At leave I've got some money saved up to tide me over for now. You've been working too much recently, so please take care of yourself.
