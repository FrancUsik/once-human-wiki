Territory[]
The Territory is an essential part of Once Human gameplay. Your territory is a home for your player to craft, cook, disassemble parts and relax. Within the journal you have a variety of tasks that will guide you through the territory mechanics. In this world, danger lurks around every corner. If you want to survive, you can’t just rely on your own strength, your backpack, and your motorbike. You need a place to store important items, to use better tools, a place of relative safety - you need a home. Getting started is easy. Simply construct a Territory Core, circle off the area around it, and boom! You’ve got yourself your very own Territory. Your Territory is the place where you can store your precious loot inside Crates, and use advanced workbenches to produce more sophisticated pieces of equipment. All those raw materials you’ve been hunting and gathering can now be transformed into delicious, sustaining meals, or even a soft bed upon which to lay your head at the end of the day.
Hives can no longer make a shared Hive Territory, instead hive members can use other hive members territory facilities and build next to each other. 
Players can move their entire territory by entering the build menu and then pressing the move territory keybind, "Z" button by default.

Prints[]
Prints are used to change the visuals of your Structures, such as wallpapers for walls or different skins for facilities. 

House Blueprint[]
All structures can be blueprinted and saved to your account to rebuild after a seasonal reset or to build copies. The player can blueprint specific structures within the territory or blueprint the entire territory as one structure. When constructing using a blueprint an outline of the saved structure will be visible in the build menu, if the player as the correct materials within the territory as the blueprint then clicking on the outline will automatically build the selected piece of that blueprint. Blueprints are currently unable to snap to the grid when being placed for construction. The player can save another person's structure in their territory by entering the other player's territory, entering the build menu, and selecting the Save Blueprint option. Some items cannot be saved in a blueprint, such as a water pump.
