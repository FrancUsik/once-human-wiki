My darling, if you get in any more trouble, your father will send you to Rosetta. David Brewster is not a fatherly man. You should know what a devil he is. He loves money, loves power, but he doesn't love you or me. Rosetta's terms were too tempting for him, and a mere child is nothing compared to that.
First David just helped Rosetta negotiate with suppliers, but then Rosetta asked if he could acquire test subjects for Rosetta's experiments. Their human experiments. You see, Beth, you're the easiest person for David to hand over, alongside me. We should pray we don't anger him, or he might just do so. Trust me, he would do it; losing his wife and daughter for a few more zeroes at the end of his bank account would strike him as a good deal.
