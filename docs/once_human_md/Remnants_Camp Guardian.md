That kid is truly brave, far beyond what I had initially imagined. Brave, resilient, and kind-hearted, she should not have borne such a heavy burden.
When the wold broke in, none of us in the living room noticed at first. It wasn't until Mrs. Modesty began to scream that we realized something was wrong. But she had already opened fire. A slender girl, armed with an old pistol, managed to protect all of us from the jaws of a starving wolf! Thankfully, the slain wolf was not contaminated, which is another stroke of luck. It seems we can hold on for a while longer.
