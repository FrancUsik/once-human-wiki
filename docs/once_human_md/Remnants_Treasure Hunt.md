# Remnants/Treasure Hunt

I found my way to this dump - thanks to that map - ready to find me some treasure. And you know what, the map wasn't lying. I found the spot marked on the map, then always put my back out digging several meters down through the muddy sludge, and there they were! Five beautiful Spanish hams wrapped in brown paper! Moldy as anything, and covered in a thick layer of Stardust, but that just added to the flavor, in my opinion.
The only question is, why did the genius who drew this treasure map go and mark the spot with a weapon crate symbol?!
