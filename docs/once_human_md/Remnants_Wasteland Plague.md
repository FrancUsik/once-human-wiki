The packs of wild dogs have become an even more severe threat than the Deviants. Last week, that kid Eli "Eggshell" lay in ambush by the roadside, probably hoping to encounter a lone traveler and scavenge something. The next day, we found him torn apart, scattered across dozens of square meters at the intersection, with his bones gnawed clean. We need to quickly gathered a few people, take several guns, and deal with those beasts. Once the wild dogs get a taste for human flesh, the casualties are bound to increase in numbers next time.
