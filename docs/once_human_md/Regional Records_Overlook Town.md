Regional Records/Overlook Town[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
At one time, the Dayton Wetlands was under the complete control of one family - the Sutherlands. The Sutherland family had been investing heavily in Overlook Town, with the grand aim of making it into a thriving new settlement.
I passed through the town once around this time, and when I saw it, the entire place was one big construction site. Row upon row of unfinished houses, the freshly-poured foundations for luxury beach-side villas... even a movie theater, although it was only half-finished (they never did finish it, in the end).
Of course, most of the town's real estate, the motel, the supermarkets, and most of the other commercial properties all belonged to one certain member of the Sutherland family. I only stayed in that town for as long as it took for a tank of overpriced gas. Something about the place game me the creeps.
And then there was the Starfall. Overlook Town will never get built now. All that luxury - the beautiful furniture, the expensive appliances - is just sitting there gathering dust. The whole town stands like a monument to the people who perished trying to construct it.
The place was silent as a tomb when we arrived. From a distance, the old site looked almost completely intact. No signs of the Marauders. Keith and Amelia were both strongly in favor of exploring, but I decided not to take the rise. There are dark forces lurking in that place, I'm sure of it. Otherwise, the place would've been stripped clean of valuables long ago.
