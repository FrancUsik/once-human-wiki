Power Outages[]
Colm Monte, Electrician
Overlook Town, South Dayton Wetlands
August 9,  ▮▮17
Rosetta promised to bring economic growth and jobs to this crappy island... Hmph! We ain't seen none of that so far.
Back in the old days, at least we had a but of time to kick back and relax in the evenings. Even if there wasn't much fish to catch, and rare good shipments were few and far between, at least we could still just sit back on the sandy beaches, look out at the clear blue ocean, and soak up that sun.
But now, shit, we've all become slaves to labor contacts. Rosetta has found a way to squeeze cash out of everything. Every shipment of goods, every ear of corn grown out in the fields, even the electricity... It's a disgrace. Mola Island has had a stable electricity supply for decade, but ever since Rosetta showed up and forcibly took over the power grid we've been having all these power cuts.
And all this, just to build that damn Black Tower.
Keefer Sutherland must be in some kind of serious trouble for him to allow these Rosetta scumbags in. Sutherland and his cronies are the oly ones making decent money out of this. Is the Old Man blind? Why does he allow his nephew to carry on like this?
