This building is big enough,there are plenty of supplies, the people here are sane, yet I still feel uneasy. We've blocked off this shopping mall to protect ourselves and kept out all the crazy stuff out there (people and things). The screams outside are horrifying, it's like hell has opened up, full of blue flames.
... I don't know how many days it's been. Maybe it's better that way. Do I really want to know how many days I've been here, or how much longer I have left to live? Heh, at least there's enough booze to last me a lifetime.
