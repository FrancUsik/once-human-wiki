# Remnants/Goodbye, Legion of Light.

Goodbye, Legion of Light.[]
Martin
Found in Deadsville
I remember the first day we dropped into Nalcott, my brother was a master at these games and I, I was a noob. We played for many season, little did I know that the last season was the last time I'd get to play with him.
You see this isn't my story, this is the story of my Brother Richard (in game Name LegionOfLight) and mine was LegionOfDarkness. He battled cancer for 6 years before being taken on his final battle. It's in his honor that I continue to play and progress, so the loss of my brother will always be with me, but his heart will live on through his Character and Me.
He never once complained, always helped people out in the game and out of the game. So you could say that this Letter is to Him so all I will say is this:
"Brother, thank you for always being there and being my guide and my Conscience, I will miss you but will see you in the game every time I play Your Fight is over, your demons slain. Go peacefully to the light and I will see you again one day."
Love your Brother Martin.
