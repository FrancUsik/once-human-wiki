Otto II, Rosetta Researcher
Secret Harbor, Southeast Iron River
March 28, ▮▮30
Sergeant Major Burgess I-S0112, you finally returned. You'd only been in Rosetta for a year when you evacuated. Now it's been, what, ten years? How do you feel about being back here?
I thought you'd have a lot to say, like: "the scenery's the same, but that person before is gone," or "that ignorant youth Patrick disappeared during Starfall, now only a loyal Rosetta soldier remains." You were always a good talker. Hey, you don't have to get angry, I'm not being sarcastic. I'm the same as you, now: Otto II-S2904, affiliated with the Rosetta Research Institute, mainly responsible for securing Deviations.
According to Rosetta's regulations on securing Deviations, as an instructing researcher on Deviation securement, I have the right to select the securement team myself. I hereby inform you that the S0016 Squad of Sergeant Major Burgess-IS0112 shall gather at 6:00 AM tomorrow morning and go to Deviation Point 0427 to carry a securement task.
