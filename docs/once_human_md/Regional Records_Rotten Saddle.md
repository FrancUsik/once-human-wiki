Regional Records/Rotten Saddle[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Rotten Saddle, where the "cancer" first began to spread - the Vultures, if I must - they are this crazed and ruthless gang that casts a shadow of death over Chalk Peak.
The residents of Tall Grass have confirmed this us. Vultures were active here in the early days under the guise of prophets, healers, and philosophers. It also allowed Vulture leaders to recruit their first followers, who were also the earliest members of the gang. They gradually corrupted more residents until the entire sanctuary fell, and all the righteous people who refused to abandon their consciences were killed. The remaining scumbags... turned this place into a total bandit lair.
But then, they left too. Perhaps it was due to the intensification of Stardust contamination, causing Deviants to group up and invade this place? Or maybe it was because there were no more settlement nearby for them to plunder and they needed to go to new "hunting grounds" to find more prey.
I will try my best to record the information about this place to warn future generations. If one day the Vultures become the enemy of the Union (which is bound to happen as long as they exist), we need to learn our enemy's origins.
