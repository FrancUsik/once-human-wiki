Characteristics[]
The elegant Luna Moth (also referred to as Luminara) seems as though it could be a prized piece in an upscale lighting connoisseur’s collection. Surrounded by clusters of ember-like moths, its presence is both mesmerizing and deadly. Though the flames of these smaller moths may appear weak, their wings are capable of igniting fires so intense they can melt steel and reduce bodies to ash.

Behavior[]
Luna Moths glide around effortlessly, their feet hovering slightly above the ground. When provoked, they command their swarm of fiery moths to attack, inflicting fire elemental damage over time on their pursuers.

Tips[]
To maximize damage, target the Luna Moth’s lampshade head.
