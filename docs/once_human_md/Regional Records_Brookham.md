Regional Records/Brookham[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
Brookham is the largest settlement in the Dayton Wetlands. It used to have a population of over two thousand, with a bustling main street running through it. At one time, it was possible to buy pretty much anything on that street, even some quite specialty items. Business hours weren't restricted either, and many stores were open all night long.
Of course, that was all before the Starfall. Now, it houses the graves of over two thousand dead.
Brookham seems to have been annihilated in an instant. We didn't find a shred of evidence that there were any survivors, apart from a few people who appeared to have taken refuge in the station waiting room. They huddled there for a few hours, it seems, trying hopelessly to seal the door against the Rift Entities that were pouring out from the Monolith.
I had everyone scope out a few rooms quickly. We got a good haul - enough to supply the whole team for the next few days. But we didn't dare stay long. This place is too close to the Monolith, and Stardust pollution levels are extremely high. Can't get greedy.
