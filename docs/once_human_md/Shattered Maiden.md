Lore[]
Rosetta Research Documentation[]
O-039 is a ceramic doll in the shape of a girl, standing at approximately 1.3 meters tall and weighing around 70 kilograms. She wears a red cotton dress, and her head is covered by a large brown paper bag (designated O-039-A), which has two eye holes and cartoonish expressions drawn on with colored crayons. O-039 is hollow inside, and its face is missing, replaced by a black void where the head should be, with clear signs of damage throughout its body. Due to O-039’s personality and Deviation Effects, all attempts to investigate its interior have failed.
O-039 has the intelligence of a ▊▊-year-old human and appears well-educated. She generally has a lively and gentle personality and is willing to help others. Though nonverbal, she is able to communicate with researchers through writing and body language. When O-039-A is removed, the object becomes extremely distressed and will lash out with fierce aggression, attempting to chase, push, or scratch any human within view. O-039 is physically weak and unlikely to cause significant harm, and her blind attacks may even result in self-injury. However, due to her Deviation Trait, lingering in her presence remains dangerous.
O-039's primary Deviation Trait is a cognitohazard: any human who sees the hole where her face should be experiences intense fear and will attempt to escape as quickly as possible. A small percentage of particularly sensitive individuals may immediately fall into a coma, and in extreme cases, some have suffered sudden cardiac arrest. Covering one’s eyes with hands or closing them does not provide protection against O-039’s Deviation Trait. The object's optical image penetrates biological tissue, leading O-039 to always feel as though she is being "watched."
Appendix: Identification of Deviation O-039’s Effects
Staring directly at O-039’s face for ▊▊ minutes or more results in irreversible neurological damage and cognitive distortions, including but not limited to:

Permanent loss of the ability to recognize human faces.
Permanent facial nerve paralysis.
Perceiving black voids similar to O-039’s face in place of human faces (including but not limited to real faces, pictures, and images).
Seeing cracked textures similar to O-039’s face, with viscous black liquid ("tears") flowing from the cracks on other human faces.
Securement Procedures:
DO:

Secure O-039 in a Grade VI or higher Securement Cell for autonomous entities, furnished according to the object's requests. Ensure the walls and furniture are covered with soft materials.
Allow O-039 to visit the site leisure area once a week to engage in activities, accompanied by personnel with a Grade V4 or above clearance. Install multiple concealed mind-shielding field generators in O-039’s Securement Cell and any area where it engages in activities.
Provide O-039 with books or other audiovisual materials as requested.
Wear a psychohazard barrier when entering O-039’s Securement Cell or interacting with O-039.
DO NOT:

Touch O-039.
Place any mirrors in the object’s Securement Cell or in any area where it engages in activities. All items in these areas must be sandblasted or treated similarly to prevent the formation of reflective surfaces.
