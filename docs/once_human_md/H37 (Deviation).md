Summary[]
H37 is a Territory Deviation that gathers materials available from nearby enemy strongholds; but only materials which are normally acquired from a Disassembly Bench; for example Adhesive, Electronic Parts, Rubber, etc. H37 will not gather anything not normally available nearby, ie. if you can't gather it neither can H37.

How To Get[]
H37 is part of the Realm of Nightmares tasks, she can be found at (5321,-3802) near Refinery Pollution Point, on the second floor inside a small corrugated metal building.
H37 is obtained by completing the side task Fragments of Memory which ends at her final destination in Greywater Camp at (5375,-3235).
This Deviation also has a random chance to drop from optional boss in Securement Silo - ALPHA in Chalk Peak.

Abilities[]
explorer (Activated); Loots chests in different areas. The higher the Deviant Energy level, the better the goodies it will bring back.
Trivia[]
The game centers around "H73" (believed to be your Rosetta test subject designation), which makes the designation "H37" somewhat interesting, though it is unclear if there is any significance/relationship.
