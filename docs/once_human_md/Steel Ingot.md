Steel Ingot Farming / Energy Link Farming[]
Steel Ingots are often considered as one of the easier ways to earn Energy Links from the Settlement Traders in all stages/phases of a Scenario, often requiring very little material or time in comparison to higher tiered items that can be sold, in addition to granting a large amount of Asterium used in the Steller Stairway for Starchrom.
For Example: 3,334 Steel Ingots can max out an individual traders weekly selling limit which would only require 16,670 Iron Ore on a default Electric Furnace, but this can be refined further if the players have access to an Electric Furnace with the Memetic Specialization "Furnace: Precision Refining" which lowers the cost to 4 Iron Ore per Steel Ingot and lowering the number to 13,336 (Saving 3,334 Iron Ore per individual trader).
As Iron Ore is accessable at all phases of the game (such as the Iron River Region in Manibus), it can be farmed in large quanitities and smelted/crafted rather quickly, allowing players to make big farm runs to acquire the ore and sell for a fair price at traders. The process can be made even faster and/or easier if the player has access to additional bonuses, such as Memetic Specializations: "Backpack Expansion" (increasing the players overall backpack size), "Load Handling" (reducing Ore Weight by 40%/60%/80% depending on material consumption) or by the use of an Electric Rock Drill, Advanced Electric Rock Drill or the Solar Drill (Increasing Ore Yield by 15%/25%/40% depending on Material Consumption). If a player has access to a Solar Drill and a Tier 3 Load Handling (80%) item, they are capable of carrying the 16,670 Iron Ore required for a single trader in one trip making the entire process significantly faster.

Trivia[]
Iron Ore can first be found within the Iron River region, but can also be found in locations above that level such as Chalk Peak, Red Sands and Blackheart Region.
Steel Ingots can be sold for 15 Energy Links to Traders. (3,334 recurring Steel Ingots would be needed to max out a Traders weekly selling limit.)
Unlike Copper, Bronze, Aluminum, Tungsten, Silver, Gold or Stardust Ingots, Steel Ingots have a more unique "pressed plate" look to them.
