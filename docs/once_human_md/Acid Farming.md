# Acid Farming

Acid is an essential end-game item, used in multiple crafting recipes, such as tungesten and aluminum ingots, which are imperative to crafting late game armor, ammunition, and weapons. Due to its increased need players may want to farm deviants or locations, or set up their own AFK acid farm on their territory.

Farming Deviants[]
Killing deviant a has a high chance to yield 2 acid, to collect the acid you must loot the body after killing. To know if a deviant has dropped items you will see a white circle with whisps flowing upwards, pressing the interact button will automatically collect all items dropped, alternatively the player can hold the interact button to only collect desired items.
To increase the amount of acid dropped from deviants the player can consume preserved deviated chops which will give the player +100 energy, and the food buff Hunter's Luck for 1800 seconds (30 minutes), increasing acid gain by 50% when defeating deviants.

Farming Locations[]
Silos[]
Securement Silos can be found all around Nalcott, containing enemies such as deviants or Rosetta agents, and either one singular final boss, or will include a pre-boss fight before the final boss fight. To clear silos, the player must defeat the boss at the end of the dungeon. While there are multiple enemies on the way to the boss area of silos exterminating them is often not neccessary, but, depending on the type of enemy, will yield extra acid.
In the Manibus scenario there are 6 silos:

Securement Silo - SIGMA (Broken Delta, recommended level: 15)
Securement Silo - PHI (Iron River, recommended level: 25)
Securement Silo - ALPHA (Chalk Peak, recommended level: 35)
Securement Silo - EX 1 (Chalk Peak, recommended level: 35)
Securement Silo - THETA (Red Sands, recommended level: 45)
Securement Silo - PSI (Red Sands, recommended level: 45
In the Way of Winter scenario there are 4 silos:

Securement Silo - Delta (Onyx Tundra, recommended level: 10)
Securement Silo - EX 1 (Onyx Tundra, recommended level: 20)
Securement Silo - PSI (Vena Fjord, recommended level: 30)
Securement Silo - 08 (Ember Strand, recommended level: 40)
Workshops[]
Workshops, also known as refineries, act as a wave defense event, sending out a notification across regional chat to notify nearby players that a player has started the event. Workshops can be a good way to get acid if the player has accumulated several extraction permits, even at high levels, due to a special feature of the event that allows players to use items in their inventory to build defensive fortifications around the workshop to help with stopping deviants from accessing the source power recycler, or turrets to help with killing enemies as they spawn in. Note: high level workshops are recommended to be done in a team of 2, as enemies that successfully destroy the source power recycler will end the event and the maximum rewards will be lost until the next attempt.

AFK Acid Farm[]
Although slow, this method is one of the best ways to passively gather acid, and if started soon into Phase 2: Tame the Staroid can net the player a substantial amount in coming phases. To build the acid farm the player needs to have unlocked the following memetic nodes found in the Logistics section of the memetics screen:

Water Pumps (5 ciphers,  700body[data-theme="light"] .mw-parser-output .energy-links-icon{filter:drop-shadow(0 0 0.125em black)})
Osmosis Water Purifiers (10 ciphers,  5000)
Brewing Barrels (7 ciphers,  2000)
Building the Farm[]
To build an acid farm in a territory the player will need to live in a polluted area*. In Nalcott multiple areas have been infected due to Starfall, and they can be found by exploring the wilderness. Players should pay close attention to their Cradle for numbers appearing on the face and a beeping sound, indicating that they are currently in a polluted area. As of yet there does not seem to be an increase in acid yield dependent on the pollution amount. Once the player has found a polluted area they wish to set up their territory, they should then search for a water source within that area. After that is complete the player can place their territory, ensuring that the water in the area is both inside of the player's territory and inside of the polluted area.
*The player's Sanity will drop in polluted areas, so ensure that a mask is equipped that can handle the area.

1. Once the territory is placed, the player should place a water pump inside of the water source, note: there are 2 items with the name water pump, for this reason from here on out the water pump that takes water up from the ground is called a water pump and the water pump that can make water travel upwards inside of pipes will be called an electric pump. Next, the player should build a large water filter (previously known as an osmosis water purifier) lower down than the water pumps. Connect an electricity source to the water pump and the large water filter, and a water pipe from the water pump to the large water filter. If the large water filter is located lower than the water pump gravity will move the water in to it automatically, however if this is not possible an electric pump can be built and powered, and connected from the water pump to the large water filter to allow the water to travel upwards.
2. With the water pump now powered it will slowly begin to collect dirty water and polluted water. The water pipes will take both the dirty and polluted water into the large water filter, where the dirty water will be turned into purified water and the polluted water will be turned into impure acid.
3. The final step is to build a brewing barrel, and power it. Then connect a water pipe from the large water filter to the brewing barrel, this allows for the purified water and impure acid to travel into the barrel, where it will automatically start to produce acid. Again, if the brewing barrel is located higher than the large water filter an electric pump can be built, powered, and connected to allow the water to travel upwards.
This farm can be modified by either adding additional water pumps and large water filters, or by adding water tanks to help keep the water pumps from backing up. If the player wishes to add water tanks they will be able to do so from the prerequisite memetic node: Water Storage (3 ciphers,  200).

Trivia[]
During an update to the game in late 2024 polluted areas now give dirty water as well as polluted water, therefore it is worth while to check back now and then to the farm to see if the water pumps are completely backed up with dirty water.
