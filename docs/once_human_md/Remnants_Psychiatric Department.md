"We're a small clinic, there's no psychiatric department, please go to the hospital for treatment, thank you." I must have repeated this sentence 50 times in the past three days!
What happened recently? All these people wanted to see a psychiatrist. Some said that they saw a vanished civilization, others that there was a black hole in their house. Is it something in the water causing this?
