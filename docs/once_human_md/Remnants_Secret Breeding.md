This old farm is an excellent spot to carry out my experiments! I've reaped a bountiful harvest of fruits and veggies this year - tomatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots... Of course, they're all contaminated by Stardust and therefore inedible. But that's okay, they still make good feed for the animals. The deer and pigs are growing nicely. Every day they get a bit more mutated. My stags are going to be the highlight of the sacred ceremony. Nobody else's livestock will have as many heads as mine! Ha!
