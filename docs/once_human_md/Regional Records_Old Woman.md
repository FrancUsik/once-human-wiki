Old Woman[]
Old Woman: ...Marlo? Is that you? You've finally come to visit me!
Caretaker: No, no, I think you're confusing me for... Uh, actually, yes, you're right! It's me, Marlo, your husband.
Old Woman: You're so late, Marlo. It's been so long...
Caretaker: Yes... but I'm here now. Do you remember where you're going?
Old Woman: A birthday... party?
Caretaker: That's right. Your birthday party! Your children will come to celebrate with you.
Old Woman: Oh, that's wonderful. Quick, my... my coat... where is it?
Caretaker: It's just there, to your left. Just turn your head and you'll see it.
Old Woman: That's odd... Where is it? Why... can't I find it...
