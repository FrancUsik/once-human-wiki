Characteristics[]
Rainfall Reapers move with the breeze, eagerly awaiting their beloved rainy days. They resemble floating female garments draped around an invisible, roughly humanoid form, standing approximately 1.5 to 1.7 meters tall. This design might mimic predatory behavior or reflect a preference for a human-like appearance. Instead of a head, they have an umbrella dripping with sticky black slime, which is mildly corrosive and serves as their vital organ. The umbrella handle extends into the neckline of the clothing, with thin, black, viscous tendrils supporting the empty humanoid form. Explosive stardust gathers under the umbrella and can spread quickly through humid air.

Behavior[]
Rainfall Reapers are extremely lightweight and possess exceptional aerial maneuverability. They can control the weather within a small radius, hide themselves by refracting light, and even summon unusual weather phenomena like black rain for short periods. This behavior is difficult to predict, making them dangerous foes. They become aggressive only when in a predatory state, attacking any lifeform that poses a threat to them.

Strategy[]
When engaging with the Rainfall Reaper, prioritize targeting the umbrella.

Notes[]
Metas can temporarily use the umbrella left behind by the Rainfall Reaper as a weapon after the entity is defeated.
According to old lore, this enemy would “...use its corrosive slime to digest the victim’s flesh and then assume the form of the victim’s clothing as its new ‘shell.’” The lore also suggested that “...if encountered without means of resistance, attempting to remove all clothing might temporarily cause the entity to cease its attack, though success was often limited.”
Previously referred to as “Rain Shell” in early developer promotional materials.
