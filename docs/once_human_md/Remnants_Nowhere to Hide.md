Sorry to bother you, Director, I know you are extremely busy. I just wanted to follow up on our conversation from earlier. During our meeting, you told me that it is not possible that the Monolith could be having negative impacts on local residents or ecology. You also described the reports of strange, otherworldly incidents as "unfounded rumor and hearsay."
Well, I believe it is my duty to inform you that the number of patients coming to my clinic has been steadily increasing in recent weeks. Many of them are presenting with extremely peculiar symptoms - symptoms I've never seen documented in any medical text. I understand that my role is to alleviate local fears about Rosetta and improve community relations. But, if I may speak plainly, I am now concerned that, if the situation on the ground continues to worsen, we may lose control of the situation. Thank you for taking the time to read this note. I look forward to receiving your response.
