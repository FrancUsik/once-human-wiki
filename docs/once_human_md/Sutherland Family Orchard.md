Summary[]
Sutherland Family Orchard is located in Dayton Wetlands at 7205, -5237.

History[]
This orchard was once one of the Sutherland family's most important properties and the most "legitimate" part of their business. Anne Sutherland - the woman who ran the place - was an elegant lady, widely admired by those who knew her.
