# Deviation

You may encounter Deviations when defeating enemies, picked up as loot while exploring the wilderness, including wilderness containment units in both friendly and wilderness strongholds, or obtained from certain events (event deviations are bound to you). If you are new to the game - it is a good idea to capture them as they offer various benefits, but note that your backpack cannot hold more than 96 deviations. Any surplus deviations can be deposited to containment units - up to 20, sold for 500 Astral Sand, or non-bound deviations can be donated to other players by discarding unnecessary deviations next to other players. Deviations cannot be sold to NPC vendors for Energy Links (only to Eternaland Island Shop for Astral Sand), listed for sale in vending machines, or added to direct player-to-player trades.
There are three types of Deviations: Combat, Territory, and Crafting. Use the interact button, by default "F", when facing a floating Deviation to initiate its capture, or to pick up a deviation that is either a piece of wilderness loot, or has been discarded by another player. Your success in capturing a floating Deviations depends on the Deviation Capture stat of your gloves, which increases with the repair and tier of the gloves (being highest for fully repaired tier V gloves), and can be increased further by some consumables. Unlike floating deviations, discarded/loot deviations are guaranteed to be picked up regardless of gloves/consumables status, as they act as regular lootable items. Collected Deviations will be added to your backpack. If you already have 96 deviations in your backpack - captured deviations will be sent by mail (note that in this case you will be unable to pickup discarded/loot deviations). Open your backpack and select the Deviations tab to view your collection of Deviations. 
Deviations are not restricted to one season and at the end of the season are all moved to the Spacetime Backpack, from which any of them can be retrieved in the next season for 400 Material Points. As with any item purchased from the Spacetime Backpack for Material Points - each non-event deviation will be bound to you for 7 days before it can be discarded for other players. Event-obtained deviations are permanently bound.
