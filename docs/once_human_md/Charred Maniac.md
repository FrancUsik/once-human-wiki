Characteristics[]
Signs of Infection[]
The Charred Maniac shows obvious external signs of mutation, indicating that it has already become somewhat less than human. And yet, occasional glimpses of the person within are still visible, if you look closely. This is the firs stage of transformation after a human embraces Stardust.
Charred Maniacs have withered muscles, festering skin, long hyperplastic arms, weakened legs, cloudy eyes, and a crooked jaw. There's almost something of the uncanny valley about these guys,

A Maniac's Attack[]
Thanks to their stark physical mutations, the Charred Maniacs can only launch attacks in the most primitive ways - simple, yet dangerously infectious.
Driven by a compulsion to attack, the Charred Maniacs help propagate the Stardust infection. Any minor wound they inflict could conscript a human into their ranks.

Born Human[]
The last sight of every Maniac is a brilliant burst of Stardust, and in that spectacular final scene, they lose their human identity forever.
As the transformation begins, the human tissue is rapidly consumed. The host's body becomes emaciated, yet significant bran functions remain, preserving some past habits, like lurking near human strongholds or emitting intermittent sounds.
For survivors, the grim necessity of ending these transformed beings is both crucial and cruel.

Strategy[]
Aim for the head. However, be aware that some Charred Maniacs can still attack even after their head has been removed.

Locations[]
Charred Maniacs are low-ranking enemies, commonly found throughout Nalcott.

Drops[]
Chance of dropping Acid.

Trivia[]
The first stage of a humanâ€™s transformation into a Gnawer.
