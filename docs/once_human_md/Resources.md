Foraging[]
Foraging in the wilderness is one of the most common aways to obtain materials. There are various types of flowers, fruits, herbs and vegetables. Harvesting these in the wild give a small chance to obtain their seeds, allowing for them to be replanted by the player for continuous growth. For more detail on how to plant and grow seeds see: Seeds and Agriculture.

Hunting and Fishing[]
Hunting and fishing can be key aspects of the players playthrough, depending on their in-game diet and activities. Although hunting animals will bring the player resources such as raw meats, furs and hides, and milk, and fishing will bring the player fish to cook and eat, they may consider ranching; by capturing and taming certain animals the player can continuously gather furs and hides of different rarities, and milk. If the player is in need of pristine meats, they can slaughter their tamed animals. For more information on ranching see the page: Ranching.
