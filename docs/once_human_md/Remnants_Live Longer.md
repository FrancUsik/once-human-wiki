I seem to be living longer than expected...
Sure enough, the potential of human beings is unlimited, including the potential to kill.
Every fight is battle of life and death, and everyone defaults to the only rules of the game. There are no weapons here, and anything you could pick up is totally smooth. If there were sharp objects, maybe the deaths would be a little faster and less painful.
I'm exhausted. Tomorrow will be another hard fight. I've got another premonition of imminent death. This time it should be true. There are still five people left, we've spent more than three months here. Maybe the outside has calmed down. We have to find a way to persuade them to go out and check.
