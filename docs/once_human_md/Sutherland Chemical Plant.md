It looks like they managed to hold on for two years, one year, maybe even less. And it's easy to see why. There wasn't much in the way of food stores, and the land around the plant is completely barren even now. The poison of Stardust runs deep."

Summary[]
Sutherland Chemical Plant is located in Broken Delta at 5067,-6213.

History[]
After surviving the initial Starfall attack, the chemical plant works became desperate and scared, blaming the Sutherland Family for the catastrophe as the family were the ones who first brokered Rosetta's entry into Nalcott. Driven into madness by their fear, the workers decided to "deal with" the plant managers - brothers Donald and Nelson Sutherland - themselves, before turning their uncontrollable anger on the rest of the Sutherland family &#91;1&#93;.
According to Denise Cooper, it appears the workers survived in the chemical plant up to two years before perishing &#91;1&#93;.
Over ten years later, Ms. Han is the only known survivor of the Sutherland Chemical Plant to still be living &#91;1&#93;.
