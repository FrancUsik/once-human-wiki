I am Captain Denise Cooper, this journey began from Blackfell on February 1, 2031 CE. After entering the Chalk Peak region in late November, the advance was slowed significantly by inclement weather, bad terrain, and a variety of unforeseen situations. Keith's leg was injured, so he stayed at Tall Grass, both to recuperate and to help those friendly survivors with his knowledge.
Big troubles still lies ahead - the town of Greenlake Hill is quite possibly the most populous and organized cluster of survivor settlements we ever discovered (it's so inconceivable that the entire valley still remains safe and sound!). But they are incredibly anti-foreign that they have ignored all our requests to make contact, and they have kept us out for three days now.
I can't afford to waste any more time. If they still won't let us through, I'll have to find another route.
For example, the Stardust Pollution Zone at the northern foot of Chalk Peak...
