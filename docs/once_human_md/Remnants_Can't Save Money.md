The factory's had so many orders recently, I haven't been able to properly rest for two days. I still need o get the goods from here to the construction site on the other side of the river. After unloading them, I need to check the quantity, and then return for a second trip. The boss doesn't care how tired I get behind the wheel, he just sits back on his sofa and watches the numbers go up in his bank account.
When will I have saved up enough to marry Elena?
Randall's such a cheapskate, he's always trying to screw me out of my overtime. At least Rafael's river, plus I met Elena through him. To think, the yoga teacher of my boss's brother, someone so beautiful (and flexible...) would fall in love with me! Just thinking about it is motivating me to get back to ork and starts earning more money!
