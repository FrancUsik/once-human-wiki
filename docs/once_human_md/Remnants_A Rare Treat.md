The "ball" was a great success. Hannah looked like she was having the time of her life, and the Buckners looked happier than I'd seen them in ages. Even Nancy Russell cracked a smile or two. Mayor Sidney Russell reckons we should do something like this every month or two from now on. He says it does us all good.
Captain Catherine and I were the only ones who didn't join in. We were at the Outpost all night, on our feet the whole time, frozen stiff from holding our rifles. Hannah brought us over a sliver of pea cake and tea though. I love that woman so much, I'd marry her in an instant. Oh no wait, I already did that! Haha!
This year's harvest wasn't too bad. We even made wine with surplus tubers. We've been working hard, I don't think the odd drink is too much to ask for. We've kept the monsters and beasts out, and the Marauders are too busy infighting to pose a threat. Hopefully those Marauders just tear each other to pieces. Life isn't too bad, all things considered. We can't undo the Starfall, obviously, but we don't have to spend the rest of our lives in fear and despair either, you know?
