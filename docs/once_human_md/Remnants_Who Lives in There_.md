It's been a long time since I've seen Mr. Sutherland around town. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I saw him.
But I'm grateful to Mr. Sutherland - he brought us Rosetta, and Rosetta ha change our lives for the better. All these engineers and guards came, and they've got money to spend. On food, on accommodation, on entertainment... And the town is able to provide these services. That brought jobs, for both men and woman, to out not-so-thriving town.
And that huge Black Tower that Rosetta built - it's twice the size of our old church tower. I saw it "fire up" once last week. This column of ghostly blue light started shooting up from the top of the tower,
I once heard a priest say that the church is the dwelling place of God. But what about that Black Tower? Who - or what- dwells in there?
