How To Get[]
Shoot down deviants that are floating around from a small Pup Buddy-shaped balloon for a chance to receive this deviation. Not to be confused with the balloon-headed deviants typically found near an Ede spawn, which will not award a Pup Buddy.
Even though these "Pup Buddy deviants" exist in PVE scenarios, if you check the "Scenario Info" screen you will not see Pup Buddy listed. This means you cannot acquire Pup Buddy by killing these deviants in a PVE scenario.
Can be purchased for 6000 Energy Links from Jonathan in Greywater Camp.

Locations[]

Abilities[]
