This is the end! And it came so fast! Last night, Mola Island was on fire. I saw flames ten feet high, and heard the sounds of terrible screaming from across the sea. But all night long, I didn't see a single survivor.  The sun rose, and the fire eventually went out. The screams stopped, but I still didn't see any signs of life."
