# Rosetta

Rosetta, named from Rosetta Stone, is the only remaining tech giant after Starfall. They are obsessed with all kinds of radical research on heterospace life, in order to achieve the "uniform evolution" of mankind. What they did actually caused the collapse of the civilized world. Until now, Rosetta is still secretly continuing crazy attempts to influence and control the world. Rosetta has a strict internal hierarchy and masters a series of secret technologies that surpass human cognition. It is one of the main hostile forces that players need to fight against.

Enemies[]

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Rosetta Securer[]
Rosetta Securers are responsible for guarding Deviations and other experimental samples, performing the most basic and fundamental security work.
Rosetta Securers are the most common Rosetta enemy, identifiable by the 4 white lights on their helmets. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, these will be present.

Loot[]
Killing Rosetta Securers has a chance to yield any of the following items:

Grenades (1)
Gunpowder (1-3)*
Rosetta V1 Access Cards (1)
Smoke Bomb (1)
Improved Explosives (1)
Copper SMG Ammo (60)
Copper Shotgun Ammo (18)

Rosetta Researcher[]
Rosetta Researchers usually wear pure white battle suits and are armed with injection needles in their fingertips.
Rosetta Researchers are identifiable by their full white suits. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, there is a chance these will be present. Rosetta Researchers will deploy Meta Human drones, ranging from level 1 - 3; these drones will not injure the player and instead go around and attach themselves to Rosetta enemies giving them health regeneration.

Rosetta Agent[]
An exoskeleton, an assault rifle, and armed to the teeth. Rosetta Agents are one of the more common Rosetta unit types. Any time Rosetta requires the use of force, you can expect to see a few Agents.
Rosetta Agents are identifiable by the 4 blue lights on their helmets. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, there is a chance these will be present.

Loot[]
Killing Rosetta Agents has a chance to yield any of the following items:

Grenades (1)
Gunpowder (1-3)*

**The level of the Access Card recieved as a drop is dependent on the level of enemy. Higher level enemies will have a chance to drop Rosetta V2 Access Cards.


 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Rosetta Crusher[]
Rosetta frequently comes into contact with highly dangerous Deviations. If something goes wrong, the battle-hardened well-trained Crusher may be called upon to deal with the crisis.
Rosetta Crushers are identifiable by the 4 red lights on their helmets. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, there is a chance these will be present. Rosetta Crushers may also use a grenade launcher for the first few ranged attacks.

Loot[]
Killing Rosetta Crushers has a chance to yield any of the following items:

Grenades (1)
Gunpowder (1-3)*
Rosetta V1 Access Cards (1)**

Rosetta Sniper[]
Rosetta Snipers are trained to be ruthless assassins who will stop at nothing to eliminate the enemy. Rosetta likes to mobilize its Snipers when facing a high-threat target, or when they wish to avoid sustaining heavy casualties from a head-on confrontation.
Rosetta Snipers are identifiable by the singular orange light in the centre of their helmets. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, there is a chance these will be present, usually located high up in watch towers or roof tops.

Loot[]
Killing Rosetta Snipers has a chance to yield any of the following items:

Grenades (1)
Gunpowder (1-3)*
Rosetta V1 Access Cards (1)**
*The amount of gunpowder recieved as a drop is dependent on the level of enemy. Higher level enemies will drop more than lower level ones.
**The level of the Access Card recieved as a drop is dependent on the level of enemy. Higher level enemies will have a chance to drop Rosetta V2 Access Cards.


 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Rosetta Bruiser[]
Rosetta Bruisers spend their entire working lives inches from death, and are constantly surrounded by dangerous explosives. As a result, Bruisers tend to display a rather alarming lack of any sense of self-preservation.
Rosetta Bruisers are identifiable by the singular blue light in the centre of their helmets. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, there is a small chance these will be present.

Loot[]
Killing Rosetta Bruisers has a chance to yield any of the following items: 

Grenades (1)

Rosetta Heavy[]
In Rosetta, everyone wants to become a V2. Promotion to V2 means heavier armor, better weapons, and additional energy tanks, but the biggest difference is the Mini-Cradles V2s wear on their backs.

Rosetta Mechanic[]
The Mechanic is one of Rosetta's highest-ranking units, with a formidable reputation. Each Mechanic commands their own combat drone.
Rosetta Mechanics are identifiable by their glowing purple goggles. If there is a Rosetta presence in the area, there is a very small chance these will be present.
When hostile towards the player Rosetta Mechanics will send out two types of drones:

Patroller drones, ranging from level 1 to level 3; if these drones get close enough to the player it will electricute them, stopping them from moving for 5 seconds.
Rosetta Suicide Drones, if these drones get close enough to the player it will explode.
In rare cases Rosetta Mechanics will deploy a M2 Sentinel portable turret, that will shoot at the player if they are within distance.
