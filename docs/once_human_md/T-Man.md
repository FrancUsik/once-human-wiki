Agent of Justice
No one knows where T-Man came from, or who he is. Like many Deviations, he's gradually become a part of our fragmented lives.
He's an intelligent Deviation (and sure doesn't let us forget it...), and we shouldn't assume he's harmless. But still, having T-Man around does have some benefits. For example, ever since T-Man first appeared, he has shown a keen interest in "dealing with nasty post-Starfall criminal cases." He's effect too. He hunts down (or gets others to hunt down) all kinds of criminals and monsters, and makes them pay for their crimes.
The wilderness survivors can be pretty eccentric, but they are very accepting of T-Man, the so-called "agent of justice." These people like to get their revenge.
