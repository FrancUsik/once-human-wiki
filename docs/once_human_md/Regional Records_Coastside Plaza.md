Regional Records/Coastside Plaza[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
We found some indications that survivors had taken up residence in the Coastside Plaza. It seems that the place had served as a refuge for a year of two after the Starfall. Not anymore though, The place just stands empty now.
I can just imagine how... desperate... these people must had been toward of the end. That's right. It wasn't Deviants of Rift Entities that destroyed this place. It wasn't even the slow, painful creep of Stardust. It was the survivors themselves. They tore this place apart from the inside out - a premeditated assault on what little peace and stability they had managed to create.
And look at this. It looks like they tied people to these posts, doused them with gasoline, and then lit the whole thing on fire... the wind swept away the ashes of that blaze long ago, of course, but the charred black remains of those victims are still clearly visible, burned into the Earth. What must have gone on in the clinic was even more gruesome - I'll spare you the details.
Fortunately, that group of thugs didn't manage to keep hold of this place for long. Looks like the Stardust got to them... my guess is that they got badly infected and ended their lives in pain, or kept on living a painful life as a Deviant. Maybe some of them are still wandering among the ruins... and also... it's hard to tell exactly what happened here, but it seems that there was some kind of conflict. Infighting, perhaps? I saw signs of some very intense conflict, offensive and defensive.
I can't tell if the thugs were all killed in the fighting or not. But for the sake of those poor survivors, I hope none of them died peacefully.
