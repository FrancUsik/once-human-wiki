Regional Records/Eastern Railway Junction[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
The Eastern Railway Junction. I've got to note a thing or two about this place. After the Starfall, this was the most important shelter south of the Broken River. Survivors flocked here in the hundreds, Simon Meyer's gang among them, having once made their home here.
Sadly the place is now thoroughly obliterated. According to Brad Lito, a resident who fled to the Sandbank, the Eastern Railway Junction was attacked by Rosetta late last spring. The boss was publicly dealt with, and most of the remaining residents were taken away, their current whereabouts unknown.
It's a sad story, but one thing intrigues me: the boss of this place (or "Consul," as he styled himself), Owen Hicks.
Where on Earth did this guy come from? No matter who I asked - Brad, Simon, or whoever else - the one-time residents of the Eastern Railway Junction all had a high opinion of Consul Owen (and Simon looked pained to admit it). They said he was brave, decisive, and careful, with an aptitude for management and military strategy. Sounds like he must have been a military man himself, or at least an accomplished official or businessman.
Owen was said to have appeared on the day of the Starfall. Nobody had ever heard of him before then. But Owen Hicks burst onto the scene in their moment of need and used his leadership to organize a defense against the first offensive, firmly winning the people's trust. After that, he taught them to deal with the Deviants, to protect against contamination, to evade the Rift Entities...
I simply don't believe that this guy didn't have some ark, hidden background.
