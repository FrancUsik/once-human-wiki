Summary[]
Sunbury Farm is located in Broken Delta at 5121,-6593.

History[]
Sunbury Farm was once a small settlement, led by the farm owner Rebecca Blunt. After Starfall, Rebecca welcomed all who came across the farm and tried to help the survivors come to terms with their fate, and when there was no hope left, she did what she could to ease their suffering &#91;1&#93;. 
Eventually, Rebecca became the sole survivor. Before passing, she wrote a final message - essentially a last will and testament - stating that whoever found the document would inherit Sunbury Farm and all surrounding land &#91;1&#93;.
According to several pieces of lore found around the Farm, living under Rebecca's leadership was horrible. It is also highly implied that Rebecca was "helping" survivors who couldn't "accept their fate" by murdering them &#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;.
As the Player is the one who discovers Rebecca’s last words, this now makes them the rightful owner of Sunbury Farm.
