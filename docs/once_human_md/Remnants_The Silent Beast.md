The legend of the "Silent Beast" permeates this land, and many people in Tall Grass firmly believe that it preys on the living after awakening. It moves unseen, making it impossible for humans to defend against. Only through offering... sacrifices can its bloodlust be quelled, and it can be returned to slumber.
Legends often conceal fragments of truth. The "Silent Beast" must be from another world, a remnant left in our world after the Starfall. It remains relatively inactive with the closing of the Silver Gate, but still possesses the need to hunt and feed. It's lair... the Monolith, is an obvious target, where it likely lingers. However, gaining entry requires certain means, and I need more information about the "Silent Beast."
That hunter leader, Klein Warren, seems like a trustworthy man. Hopefully, he can help.
