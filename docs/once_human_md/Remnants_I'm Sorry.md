# Remnants/I'm Sorry

I'm Sorry[]
Steven Rock, Treasure Hunter
I'm sorry, young man.
I lied to you, and I truly apologize. But I had no choice. In this world, we must all do whatever it takes to survive.
This doll is my daughter's favorite to. Consider it a small compensation for what I've done to you.
