The case against Viola Jodi for secretly growing and drying tobacco (though he insists it was wild-harvested) is settled. The confiscated food supplies will be sent to the public canteen. Let Mr. Ross take a break for the next few days; hand over the ramming work to Viola. The farmland is optimistic about this year's beet harvest. I suggest we keep an extra 15% of the sugar produced in October for the kids. They deserve to put on some weight and have more reasons to smile.
Also, about the "sacrifice," they refused to negotiate. I think we should just give in to those fanatics. A few animals and some poultry is a small price to pay to keep them away from us. At least they aren't asking for human sacrifices, right?
