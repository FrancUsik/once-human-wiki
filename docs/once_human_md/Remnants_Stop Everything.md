Mr. Filmman, I'm sorry to inform you that, in light of the incoming winter, the Matriarch Council has decided to suspend educational activities at Greenlake Middle School. All students are to return to work, and you yourself will be assigned a new position in the coming days. We would like to assure you that this is just a temporary measure. The Matriarch Council understands the value of education, and hopes that the school can reopen at the earliest possible opportunity.
