Summary[]
Highland is located in Iron River at 5017,-4509.

History[]
Highland place used to be one of the most important settlements on the southern coast. It is clear from the the wreckage that High Banks was annihilated not long after Starfall. The residents were clearly taken by surprise and did little to protect themselves when the assault began. Large numbers of Rift Entities, it seems, poured into the town and simply began to feast &#91;1&#93;.
