If the report from our recon team is to be believed, there are many more survivors in the west part of Nalcott Island than we had expected. It is understood that there is a complex network of underground tunnels running between the western port and various residential areas. These tunnels, it seems, have been turned into makeshift shelters by those who survived the Starfall. Any many of them are still alive even now.
We've already reached out with some western groups, and they declared themselves member of Furutake Gumi. Furutake Gumi is a large organization, and its members are heavily armed. We should compile a full report ASAP and request instructions on how to handle this group.
