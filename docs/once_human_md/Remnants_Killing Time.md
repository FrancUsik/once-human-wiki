There's a wave of tourists here today, but alas, they're all broke. They're here for Blackfell Oil and Gas teambuilding, but Ted Holt only pays their fares and basic tickets, along with a pretty standard lunch. The well workers don't know how to spend money, so they just picked up a couple of beers at the beach and soaked up the afternoon. A couple of the girls looked alright, typical southern belles. I hadn't had my fill of them like this since the Cooper's chicks came through last season.
Let's our another drink and get on with my boring, crappy life. If only the world was ending, at least that would make my life a little more interesting.
