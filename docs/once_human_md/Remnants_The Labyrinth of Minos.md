# Remnants/The Labyrinth of Minos

The Labyrinth of Minos[]

What the hell is going on here? I've been walking in this vineyard all day, longer even.
No matter whether I keep to the right or left, I never reach the end. Even when I turn back, I immediately lose track of the direction I came from. If I stay for a while, I may lose my entire sense of direction. It's like that labyrinth from Greek legends - there's no way out!
The grapes here are weird too. They're all exactly the same, and all blue, deep blue. In two days, if I haven't found a way out, I'll be sleeping here, maybe forever. Damn, I survived so much, is this really how I'll die?
