Have you heard this soothing and melodious music? If anyone passing by stops for long enough, the sound of "Swan Lake" will pull them into this house. Everyone who was pulled in didn't tell me what it was like inside. They seemed to have lost their souls, staring blankly ahead, but their feet never stopped tapping, and they muttered to themselves as if admiring a superb performance.
For once I'm glad I have this tin ear...
