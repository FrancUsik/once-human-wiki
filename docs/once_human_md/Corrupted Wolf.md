Characteristics[]
Initially, the Eclipse Wolf seemed to benefit from Stardust, evolving into a stronger and more powerful version of itself. However, once the amount of Stardust in its body exceeds a certain threshold, a dangerous backlash begins, gradually destroying the host. This is the fate of many Corrupted Wolves, now wandering the wildernessâ€”mangy, worn down, and with little to no remaining fur.

Behavior[]
Corrupted Wolves typically travel in packs and display heightened aggression. Once they spot prey, they will relentlessly pursue it.

Strategy[]
Focus your attacks on their head to maximize damage.
