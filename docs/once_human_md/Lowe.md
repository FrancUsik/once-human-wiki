Deviation Researcher
Oh, Lowe. He's hard to describe.
He received me at a low table in a desolate outpost, surrounded by dark corners with dangerous creatures in hiding just dozen meters away. Aged stains clung to the old tablecloth and carpet.
Amid the watchful gaze of various Deviants and the flickering candlelight, he gracefully poured me a glass of Fino.
His background, which he never hides, is as deep as it is dangerous. With a mere gesture, he could make me vanish, but in these times, who doesn't have a few tricks up their sleeves to stay alive?
Regardless, his generosity was evident The Deviations he asked me to collect are extremely dangerous from the professional perspective of a Mayfly, but I agree with him on one point: since the Mayflies lack the resources to properly secure these Deviations, it's better to hand them over to him, the "professional." After all, it couldn't be worse than letting Rosetta get hold of them.
