Regional Records: Sunbury Middle School[]
Excerpt from Rediscovered
By Denise Cooper
We carefully approached Sunbury Middle School. Simon Meyer said this place is more dangerous than other areas in the wilderness - not because of Deviants or Stardust, but because it is constantly occupied by a group of extremely vicious bandits.
These bandits lived nearby before the Starfall, so they're locals, but this doesn't make them any more merciful toward other survivors. Some of Simon's people were captured by them. The look on his face when he talked about it said everything about the terrifying fates they faced.
Since then, Simon's group has been in a long struggle with the bandits. Sandbank, the shelter built on a river, has hardly seen a day of peace, with endless ambushing and counter-ambushing from both sides. The price of blood continues to rise, but neither side has gained a decisive advantage.
The school ruins needs a thorough cleanup. If I can successfully return to the north and help Simon Meyer secure more support from the Union's headquarters, this stalemate will end for sure. This is both for the victims who died at the hands of the bandits and for the development of Sandbank and the Union. There must be land in Sunbury Middle School free from Stardust contamination, and it shouldn't exist as a bandit lair.
