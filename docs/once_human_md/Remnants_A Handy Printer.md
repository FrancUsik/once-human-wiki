That thing is seriously good! A printer that can churn out farm tools and seeds? Talk about unexpected! Who would've though a Deviation could actually be so useful huh? The Mayor said that it was a gift from a Mayfly.
I'm starting to wonder if this magical printer can do even more, like conjure up fresh farm produce or ready-to-ear meals! I've been dying to find out, but the Mayor keeps warning us that complex tasks might mess up the printer and bring us a whole lot of trouble. And honestly, trouble seems to be lurking already. Those dead Deviants keep showing up in our fields way too often. It's a pretty unsettling sight, if you ask me. The thing is, none of us has the guts to clean those dead bodies up. We really need some assistance here, like ASAP.
