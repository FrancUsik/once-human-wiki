"Control Zone"? What the hell does that even mean? Yesterday, that whole stretch of mountain land was our property. And today, we've got some Rosetta business rep - and that sleazeball-looking type calling himself a "legal advisor" - know on our door to tell us that our land is now part of Rosetta's "Control Zone"?! I can understand why people are tempted. The payouts are pretty generous, especially in a place like this. But when did I agree to sell my land? So anyway, I told these dudes I'd run them over with my truck if they didn't back off.
