Blueprints[]
Blueprints allow you to craft weapons or armor you can acquire them through your Cradle Memetics menu unlocking basic blueprints or through Fusing Blueprint Fragments into a complete Blueprint. Blueprint Fragments can be found in Mysterious chests. Also in the wish machine which at this moment (excluding the grenade launcher in the memetics menu) is the only way to unlock Gold rarity Blueprints.
There are 4 rarity levels (at this time) Green, Blue, Purple, and Gold. 
To fuse a complete Weapon Blueprint you need 40 Fragments for a blue Blueprint, 60 Fragments for a Purple Blueprint, and 80 for a Gold Blueprint.  
To fuse Armor Blueprints you need 10 Fragments for a blue Blueprint, 15 Fragments for a Purple Blueprint, and 20 for a Gold Blueprint. Unlike with weapons each piece of an armor set has it's own blueprint which explains the cheaper price to fuse since most sets have 6 pieces.
There are more Fragments out in the world to be found than just enough to fuse a Blueprint.

Blueprint Enhancement Rank[]
 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 
Blueprints can be Enhanced using Blueprint Fragments to increase the rank of the blueprint increasing the starting stats of the weapon or armor. Each rarity of blueprint can be enhanced to different level of rank. Green has 3 ranks, Blue has 4 ranks, Purple has 5 ranks, and Gold has 6 ranks. To enhance a Blueprint you need either Fragments from the same blueprint or other blueprint fragments from the same category. There are 6 categories Hunter, Wanderer, Operator, Juggernaut, Beyonder, and Stranger. The category of a blueprint is shown in the background of the picture of its gear, as well as above where Blueprint Fragments are selected (seen near the bottom of the picture to the right). Additionally, the in-game Wikipedia usually lists gear category under the description, calling it "style".
Unlike when fusing it takes Exp points to enhance points rather than just a number of fragments, however each type of fragment is worth different amounts of Exp and each rank of enhancement costs more Exp to complete the enhancement. Fragments for the same blueprint are worth twice as many points.
Exp given by fragments:

Legendary - 30 Exp
Epic - 10 Exp
Fine - 3 Exp
The amount of Exp required to enhance a legendary blueprint is as follows:
Weapons:

1 star &gt; 2 stars - 1600 Exp
2 star &gt; 3 stars - 4000 Exp
3 star &gt; 4 stars - 6000 Exp
4 star &gt; 5 stars - 8000 Exp
5 star &gt; 6 stars - 10000 Exp&#91;1&#93;
Armor:

1 star &gt; 2 stars - 400 Exp
2 star &gt; 3 stars - 1000 Exp
3 star &gt; 4 stars - 1500 Exp
4 star &gt; 5 stars - 2000 Exp&#91;2&#93;
5 star &gt; 6 stars - 2500 Exp
