# Remnants/Strategic Victory

Strategic Victory[]
Frank I-S2128, Rosetta Security Squad
Breezy Shores Resort, North Iron River
April 3, ▮▮30
S0016 Squad approached along the coastline. The survivors who originally occupied Clifton, a group of bandits and Marauders, took the initiative to attack our forces. Ridiculous. Even if Rosetta security forces returned to the surface short of supplies, it would be unthinkable for us to lose a face-to-face battle against such forces. The S0016 Squad only took 40 minutes to subjugate and execute all enemy forces. Only one remember was injured: Oswald I-S1020.
Alright, look, I know there were only four guys on the other side, and S0016 Squad had the standard 20. And I know a security force led by Sergeant Major Burgess really shouldn't take so long. But those four guys were cunning and they'd spent the past decade adapting to the wilderness. Meanwhile we'd had it easy for a decade, waiting it out underground. Those underground training sessions really aren't the same, you know?
