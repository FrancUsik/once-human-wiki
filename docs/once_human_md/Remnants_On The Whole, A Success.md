On The Whole, A Success[]
Norton III-S2401, Rosetta Liaison Chief
Gaia Research Center Ruins, West Broken Delta
January 6, ▮▮30
On the whole, the mission was a success - a couple of minor accidents notwithstanding. Some of the young people were so excited at the prospect of leaving the underground bunker that they failed to take proper precautions. As a result, several young people have been infected or injured by Deviants.
Medial and Compensation teams are sufficiently well-resourced to handle these cases, and the reoccupation operation is proceeding smoothly.
In addition, there have been reports that Squad S1783 encountered a group of civilians who had survived the Starfall and had managed to avoid getting infected by Stardust at the old oil depot. As per regulations, Squad S1783 expressed out willingness to establish friendly relations, and the civilians agreed. However, it turns out that their real intentions were to lure Squad S1783 into an unfavorable fighting position and then launch an attack. The civilians launched their assault using light weapons of poor craftsmanship, but Squad S1783 was overwhelmed by force of sheet numbers, and sustained ▮▮▮ casualties. It is recommended that other operations teams do not follow the established protocol to "established contact with human survivors about ground." Henceforth, all contact with all human survivors should be avoided.
