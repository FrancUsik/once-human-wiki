# Remnants/Hole Up and Wait

Hole Up and Wait[]
John Braun, Marauder
Aiden's Hideout, Northeast Dayton Wetlands

Hinge wiped out more than half of us, but now his hideout is ours!
And it's huge! Some kind of doomsday bunker? I though only the Sutherlands or the Holts could pull off an engineering project on this kind of scale. Where the hell did Aiden  Collins get the money? Well, whatever. It's secure, well-stocked, and now our numbers are way down (every war has a silver lining, I guess), so I reckon we should be able to live down there for a decade at least.
The only problem is Shane. He's gone a bit manic recently. He's always saying that there's not enough room for development here, we should head to the west, recruit more people, do "big things"...
It's all crap, the way I see it. We're in a living hell out here, the world is full of Deviants and Stardust pollution. And he wants to make a name for himself? He's the boss, but he won't stay boss for ling if he keeps that up...
