I'm taking a risk leaving you this message - whoever you are. I'm hoping that you're still human enough to want to help. Here's the deal. I'm from a small floating shelter, out at sea. We lashed some old sampans and yachts together, and made it our home. Keep heading south from this point, and you'll find us. The water is pretty clean, and monster attacks are rare. Life is tough, but all things considered, it could be a lot worse.
If you're not much of a long-distance swimmer, just wait by the coast. We dispatch people to return to land to hunt for supplies during high tides. Ask nicely, and you should be able to hitch a ride.
